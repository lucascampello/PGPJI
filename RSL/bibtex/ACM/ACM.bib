communication students understand scrum-based agile project management, as well as
assist practitioners in introducing scrum management to a team unfamiliar with the
process. I ground the development and design of the game with a literature review
of scholarship on agile project management, games in education and business, and collaboration.
I present my methodology in the form of a game design document (GDD), while at the
same time also interrogating its usefulness, and implement Jesse Schell's game design
methodologies to frame the rules, mechanics, goals, and experience intended by my
design decisions. I conclude by turning to a series of critical game design lenses
Schell provides to discuss the intents and purposes of the game at its current prototypical
stage.},

skills important for working in industry. This includes aspects such as advancing
development and project management skills, but also improved effort estimations, first
prototypes for portfolios, and strengthening networking and communication skills.
Other prospects of such efforts can also be support for and the strengthening of local
industry by connecting and training new talents, opening recruiting possibilities,
and building a vivid and strong local developers network. In recent years, we have
run different types of game prototyping projects in different settings at Graz University
of Technology. These have included traditional digital 48-hour game jams, analog jams,
development projects running for some months, and projects with an interdisciplinary
and international setting. Each format supports different learning goals and has different
potentials to bridge industry and academia. In this paper we summarize different benefits
of the different formats and compare their potential to support (computer science)
students in learning different aspects important for their future career and discuss
general aspects related to game jams with potential for strengthening the local industry.},

abstract = {Today game engines are popular in commercial game development, as they lower the threshold
of game production by providing common technologies and convenient content-creation
tools. Game engine based development is therefore the mainstream methodology in the
game industry.Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is an emerging game development
methodology, which applies the Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) method in
the game development domain. This simplifies game development by reducing the gap
between game design and implementation. MDGD has to take advantage of the existing
game engines in order to be useful in commercial game development practice. However,
none of the existing MDGD approaches in literature has convincingly demonstrated good
integration of its tools with the game engine tool-chain. In this paper, we propose
a hybrid approach named ECGM to address the integration challenges of two methodologies
with a focus on the technical aspects. The approach makes a run-time engine the base
of the domain framework, and uses the game engine tool-chain together with the MDGD
tool-chain. ECGM minimizes the change to the existing workflow and technology, thus
reducing the cost and risk of adopting MDGD in commercial game development. Our contribution
is one important step towards MDGD industrialization.},

programming skills. Focus at the undergraduate level needs to be shifted towards developing
these collaborative skills to enable a more smooth transition into employment in industry.
The University of Victoria is in its second year of offering a course on game design.
In the first offering, new activities were introduced to address issues identified
by recent studies on university graduates entering industry. We focused on integrating
cooperative learning, group orientation, and peer review activities into the game
design process. The course attracted students across multiple disciplines, and an
analysis indicated increased student interest in pursuing a computer science degree.
Unfortunately, the same pre- and post-surveys suggested that our collaborative activities
may have resulted in a decrease in student interest regarding course work and in pursuing
studies in game design. In this paper we report on how we used a studio-based pedagogical
approach to restructure the peer review activities in our course. In our previous
offering, students received peer feedback only on their final game presentation. In
our latest offering, we integrated peer review activities into every step of the game
development process, allowing students to refine their ideas while progressing through
a game project. A quantitative analysis informs us that our refined peer review activities
were successful in increasing student presentation confidence, sense of community,
and excitement towards their course projects.},

abstract = {This article describes an extensive evaluation of introducing a game project to a
software architecture course. In this project, university students have to construct
and design a type of software architecture, evaluate the architecture, implement an
application based on the architecture, and test this implementation. In previous years,
the domain of the software architecture project has been a robot controller for navigating
a maze. In 2008, the students on the software architecture course chose between the
two domains: Khepera robot simulation in Java and XNA game development in C#. Independent
of the domain chosen, the students had to go through the same phases, produce the
same documents based on the same templates, and follow exactly the same process. This
article describes an evaluation where we wanted to investigate if a game development
project could successfully be used to teach software architecture. Specifically in
the evaluation, the effect of the choice of COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) and domain
is compared in relation to popularity of the project type, how the students perceive
the project, the complexity of the software architectures produced, the effort put
into the project, and the grades achieved for the project and the written examination.
The main conclusion is that game development projects can successfully be used to
teach software architecture. Further, the results of the evaluation show among other
things that students who chose the Game project produced software architecture with
higher complexity, and put more effort into the project than the Robot project students.
No significant statistical differences were found in final grades awarded to the Game
project students vs. Robot project students. However, the Game project students obtained
a higher grade in their project than in the written examination, whereas the Robot
project students scored higher in the written examination than in their project. Finally
compared to the Robot project students, those that chose the Game project had fewer
problems with COTS hindering the architecture design and introducing technical challenges.},

based on structural topic modeling, a probabilistic modeling technique for text mining.
The extracted topics reveal differing and common interests as well as their evolution
of prevalence over time in the two text sources. We have found that postmortems put
more emphasis on detail-oriented development aspects as well as technically-oriented
game design problems whereas AMAs feature a wider variety of discussion topics that
are related to a more general game development process, game-play and game-play experience
related game design. The prevalences of the topics also evolve differently over time

and compared the difference between the amount of work required to write the game
from scratch and the amount required using our proposed language. These evaluations
yielded promising results of 86.4% savings on programming effort, and 82.3% savings

abstract = {We propose a course design that fits a practical game development project into a regular
game design lecture course. As this approach requires a consistent structure, our
concept proposes an adaption of Scrum that is based on the game development life-cycle:
ABC-Sprints consist of three Sprints to iteratively create Alpha, Beta and Completed
versions of a game. We present a detailed walkthrough of the course and give results
of a formal evaluation. These indicate that ABC-Sprints help students to manage their
workload and to increase productivity over time. Consequently, three teams each presented
a game at the end of the course that technically exceeded typical outcomes of game
projects without lectures. We hence encourage to apply ABC-Sprints to other curricula
and provide a set of recommendations.},

issue tracking, etc. tend to be heavily process oriented. Gamification of such activities
by composing the core activities with game design elements like badges and points
can increase developers' interest in performing such activities. While there are various
frameworks/applications that assist in gamification, extending the frameworks to add
any/all desired game design elements has not been adequately addressed. In this paper,
we propose an extensible architectural framework for gamification of software engineering
activities where in the game design elements are modeled as services. We create an
example instance of our framework by building a prototype for code review activity
and note the challenges of designing such an extensible architectural framework. The
example instance uses python's Flask micro framework and has five game design elements
implemented as services, and exposed using restful APIs.},

opportunities in this process, and how they qualify design choices under the pressure
of a game jam setting. In presenting my research and future plans for my PhD project,

from a grant-funded project focused on examining documentation of the creative process

involved in the game development process, spanning a number of different roles and
institution types. The most pressing findings are related to the nature of documentation
in the videogame industry: project interviews indicate that the game development process
does produce significant and important documentation as traditionally conceived by
collecting institutions, ranging from game design documents to email correspondence
and business reports. However, while it does exist, traditional documentation does
not adequately, or even, at times, truthfully represent the project or the game creation
process as a whole. In order to adequately represent the development process, collecting
institutions also need to seek out and procure numerous versions of games and game
assets as well as those game assets that are natural byproducts of the design process
like gamma and beta versions of the game, for example, vertical slices, or different
renderings of graphical elements.},

abstract = {For several years empirical studies have spanned the spectrum of research from software
productivity, quality, reliability, performance to human computer interaction. Analyses
have involved software systems ranging from desktop software to telecommunication
switching systems. But surprising there has been little work done on the emerging
digital game industry, one of the fastest growing domains today. To the best of our
knowledge, our work is one of the first empirical analysis of a large commercially
successful game system. In this paper, we introduce an analysis of the significant
user data generated in the gaming industry by using a successful game: Project Gotham
Racing 4.More specifically, due to the increasing ubiquity of constantly connected
high-speed internet connections for game consoles, developers are able to collect
extensive amounts of data about their games following release. The challenge now is
to make sense of that data, and from it be able to make recommendations to developers.
This paper presents an empirical case study analyzing the data collected from a released
game over a three year period. The results of this analysis include a better understanding
of the differences between long-term and short-term players, and the extent to which
various options in the game are utilized. This led to recommendations for future development
ways to reduce development costs and to keep new players engaged. A secondary goal
for this paper is to introduce software game development as a topic of importance
to the empirical software engineering community and discuss research results on a
key difference area: data analytics on user data to customize user and development
experiences.},

sensory differences for neurodiverse children in a way that supports inclusive play.
Specifically, we detail the sensory driven design choices that not only support the
enjoyability of the leisure activities, but that also support the social inclusion
of sensory-diverse participants. The participants displayed behaviors in the multi-user
version consistent with their behaviors in the single user version with the addition
of social behavior. We tie these techniques to game design mechanics to iterate on
our efforts to support inclusive game development. Preliminary results are discussed.},

in fostering the generation of more interesting content in game design. In light of
the ever-increasing cost of game development, providing mixed-initiative tools can
not only significantly reduce the cost but also encourage more creativity amongst

with a focus on using evolutionary computation to procedurally generate content that
adhere to game design patterns. As part of an ongoing project, feedback from a user
study on EDD's capabilities as a mixed-initiative design tool pointed out the need
for improvement on the tool's functionalities [4].In this paper we present a review
of the principles of the mixed-initiative model, as well as the existing approaches
that implement it. The outcome of this analysis allows us to address the appointed
needs for improvement by shaping a new version of EDD that we describe here. Finally,
we also present the results from a user study carried out with professional game developers,
in order to assess EDD's new functionalities. Results show an overall positive evaluation
of the tool's intuitiveness and capabilities for empowering game developers' creative
skills during the design process of dungeons for adventure games. They also allow
us to identify upcoming challenges pattern-based mixed-initiative tools could benefit
from.},

iterative method through which we manually coded more than 200 postmortems spanning
20 years (1998 to 2018) and extracted 1,035 problems related to software engineering
while maintaining traceability links to the postmortems. We grouped the problems in
20 different types. This dataset is useful to understand the problems faced by developers
during video-game development, providing researchers and practitioners a starting
point to study video-game development in the context of software engineering.},

main result: the "old days" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are
increasing and are applied to at least 65% of projects in which 45% of this projects
explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at
least 30% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities
for video game development community.},

abstract = {The video game industry is a multimillionaire market, which makes solo indie developers
millionaire in one day. However, success in the game industry is not a coincidence.
Video game development is an unusual kind of software that mix multidisciplinary teams:
software engineers, designers, and artists. Also, for a video game to become popular,
it must be fun and polished: exhaustively well tested. Testing in video game development
encompasses different types of tests at different moments of the development process.
In particular, assessing the players' gameplay in a test session can drive the development
drastically. The designers analyze the players' actions and behaviour in the game.
They can then decide if a feature/level requires rework. They often spend many man/work
hours reworking a feature just because it is not engaging. As the designers (usually)
assess the gameplay session by hand, they cannot be sure that a specific feature is
engaging enough. They would benefit from meaningful data that would help them better
assess the gameplay and take the decision to keep, rework, or remove a feature. Consequently,
we describe the need for an IoT framework to assess players' gameplay using IoT sensors
together with game devices which will produce a rich output for the game designers.},

abstract = {Object oriented design patterns (DP) are meant to provide a common structure for solving
common software development problems. Applying those patterns is expected to improve
the software systems maintainability, comprehensibility, and provide a common language
for developers to understand and effectively communicate. However, this was not always
the case, where some studies have shown that using design patterns may lead to a system
harder to maintain and understand and more error prone; as compared to same systems
without the use of design patterns. This variation is referred to the features of
the system on hand, and the experience of the developers who are capable to know what
design patterns to use and when. Considering the video game development, the use of
software design pattern is still at low scale, and still; there is no recipe on what
and when to use design patterns. In the meantime, there are different game design
frameworks that define different aspects which need to be considered when developing
a game. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates some creational and
behavioral DP, with a specific game design framework. In this way, we claim that the
developers will have some hints on what DP to use with the main game aspects. This
framework is suitable for games which can be developed after the first course of game
design, regardless of the game engine used for development. The framework can be extended
with more DP, for larger scale and more sophisticated game.},

seven game-developing organizations, from recent startups to established organizations
to allow comparison of their use of technical infrastructure. Results: Based on our
study, the game organizations, regardless of their size, are generally pleased with
the tools they apply. The selections of the applied tools are based on their ability
to test concepts and build prototypes to help design. Conclusion: In general, the
game development organizations expect their tools to allow adaptability to changes

with their current technical infrastructure, and ability to test different solutions
was considered very important feature.},

abstract = {Dynamic strategies used by attackers to break down the software system calls for dynamic
countermeasure selection techniques. A significant challenge in engineering self-proctoring
software system is selecting a proper countermeasure while the software systems undergoes
a well-planned attack. To address this challenge, in this research work, we model
the interactions between the attacker and the software system as a two-player game.
Modeling such interaction using game theory enables the decision-making engine to
model the strategies of the attackers while considers the effect of possible defense
strategies in a dynamic attack scenario. In this research work, we aim at engineering
a novel decision-making framework that utilizes game theoretic techniques to select
the proper mitigation against an attack. The introduced framework consists of three
high-level phases including: modeling quality goal, designing game-theoretic techniques,
and realizing the decision-making engine. The first phase models the security goals
of the system and maps goal-oriented model to the designed game-theoretic technique.
Such goal model makes the decision-making engine capable of tracking the satisfaction
of modeled goals before and after applying a mitigation strategy. The framework provides
the steps to map the goal-oriented model to any game-theoretic techniques that is
suitable to model the countermeasure selection.},

that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models
of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks
at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and
3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools
and middleware make game production more widely accessible. The research contributes
to HCI research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation
enabled by new technologies and processes. Our critical review of indie developers'

abstract = {Implementing game mechanics (i.e., game rules and logic) inherently involves high
volumes of required complexity, which in turn leads to the introduction of accidental
complexity (e.g., long methods, code repetition, etc.). Thus, usually games suffer
from poor quality, i.e., attributes such as maintainability and flexibility are weakened.
A possible solution for this shortcoming is the reuse of well-known software engineering
practices, such as GoF patterns. GoF are not the only patterns that are applicable
in game development: game mechanics represent recurring problems in game design and
accompanying solutions. However, these patterns are rather abstract and no guidance
on their implementation is provided. The aim of this study is to introduce basic instantiations
of game mechanics with GoF patterns, which can potentially increase their usability
in practice. To this end, nine mappings were identified and a case study on OSS games
was performed to explore the applicability of the approach. Combining these two types
of patterns is expected to provide various benefits: (a) the game mechanics will be
accompanied with sample implementations that can be reused, to act as a starting point
for source code development; (b) these implementations will obey to good design principles---therefore
their maintainability will be safeguarded; and (c) the fact that game mechanics are
recurring, guarantees the applicability of the proposed implementations in various
games.},

software engineering process models and methods. However, in order to be effective,

To foster students to acquire knowledge (theoretical and practical) that enables them
solving similar challenges to the ones they will face in real-world software projects.Methods:
We prototype and validate a legacy game that simulates the software development process.
Students are required to plan and manage a software project according to its specification
provided by the teachers. Teachers act as both customers and moderators, presenting
the challenges and guiding the students' teamwork.Results: Both students' and teachers'
perception suggest that the proposed game has potential to motivate the knowledge
acquisition through problem-solving. The feedback also suggests that some measures
must be taken to ensure the pedagogical alignment and a fair game.Conclusion: The
lessons learned provide suggestions for adopting this or similar games in the context
of project courses. As further work, we plan to describe and extend the game rules

Game development comprised the tiers of data, logic, and presentation. During the

and comparisons of historical education goals to confirm the game's framework and
storytelling engine, selecting a construction management simulation game genre to
present tribal life and economic operations. Finally, in the presentation tier, we
converted cultural components into elements in the game's user interface.The game
evaluation results showed that “Papakwaqa” (our serious game) had positive benefits
for enhancing schoolchildren's learning motivation and performance regarding indigenous
life and history. Our research verified that integrating the cross-disciplinary methods

any normal-form game, for example, by identifying Nash equilibria or instances of
other solution concepts. Given the game model's basis in sampled data, however, empirical
game analysis must also consider sampling error and distributional properties of candidate
solutions. Toward this end, we introduce bootstrap techniques that support statistical
reasoning as part of the empirical game-theoretic analysis process. First, we show
how the bootstrap can be applied to compute confidence bounds on the regret of reported
approximate equilibria. Second, we experimentally demonstrate that applying bootstrapped
regret confidence intervals can improve sampling decisions in simulation-based game

is a visual scripting system for exploring parallel ideas in game development through
the use of alternatives at graph and node levels. These two levels of exploring alternatives
can be combined or used separately. This paper presents a use case example, which
demonstrates how SuBViS can improve workflow and communication between team members.
It also discusses a small-scale user study and the results obtained therein. SuBViS
was developed on top of Unreal Engine's existing Blueprint Visual Scripting system.},

Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, May 6-7 2010. Future Play 2010 is the
place to explore groundbreaking ideas alongside some of the world's most interesting
games researchers and developers. Future Play once again aims to foster thought-provoking
and industry-changing ideas. Our objective is to provide an atmosphere for discussion
and networking between researchers, educators, industry professionals, government
representatives, and students to advance the game industry by focusing on three main
themes. The first theme, future game development, addresses academic research and
emerging industry trends in the area of game technology and game design. The second
theme, future game impacts and applications, includes academic research and emerging
industry trends focused on designing games for learning, for gender, for serious purposes,
and to impact society. The third theme, future game talent, is designed to provide
a number of industry and academic perspectives on the knowledge, skills, and attitude
it takes to excel in the games industry. Future Play 2010 addresses these themes through
thought-provoking peer-reviewed research paper sessions, including presentations and
a poster session.Future Play 2010 evolved from the former Computer Game Technology
(CGT) Conference, initiated and presented by Algoma University beginning in 2002.
Future Play is now presented annually, and brings together academics, industry leaders,
government officials and students to consider new directions in computer game technologies
and explore groundbreaking visions for the future of game development. Since 2009,
Future Play 2010 has partnered with the Game Developers Conference® (GDC) Canada.
Game Developers Conference® Canada is a collaborative forum studying the challenges
and opportunities of creating games with long production cycles, large development
teams, and multi-platform releases.GDC Canada builds off the success of the Vancouver
International Game Summit and will be a forum for Canadian developers to share best
practices for fostering excellence and quality games within their region and distributed
globally. GDC Canada will feature a keynote address from Bill Mooney, Vice-President
of the San Francisco-based social games developer Zynga, General Manager of FarmVille.},

abstract = { Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software
engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video
game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest.
In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents.
The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other
software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary
to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints.
Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these
tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers.
These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research,
industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development,
researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests
that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment. },

describe the dynamics of actions reaction to each other in game, and aesthetics, which
describe the emotional responses evoked in the player by the game.This paper describes

most of the ordinary software development projects, but are these objectives enough
for game development, where creativity and artistic aspects have a major role? Goal:
We analyze how game developing organizations test their products, what are their main
test objectives and how they perceive themselves in the software business. Method:
We interviewed seven game development teams from different companies and studied how
they test their products with grounded theory approach. Results: Our results suggest
that game developers focus on soft values such as game content or user experience,
instead of more traditional objectives such as reliability or efficiency. Conclusions:
Game developers have similar, but not fully comparable to software industry, set of
priorities in their software testing and quality assurance approaches.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Game development has recently gained a lot of momentum and is now a major software
development industry. Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions
being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level
approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations, games
are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do
not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches
are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated
black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling
methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology,
we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed
game test modeling profile. We use domain modeling for representing the game structure
and UML state machines for behavioral modeling. We present the details related to
automated test case generation, execution, and oracle generation. We demonstrate our
model-based testing approach by applying it on two cases studies, a widely referenced
and open source implementation of Mario brothers game and an industrial case study
of an endless runner game. The proposed approach was able to identify major faults
in the open source game implementation. Our results showed that the proposed approach
is practical and can be applied successfully on industrial games.},

Respondents (n=1,394) completed baseline environmental awareness surveys and 24 respondents
participated in the game design process consisting of four workshops and online activities.
The game design component was focused on life cycle analysis (LCA) including environmental
impacts of engineering design. Observations and artifacts were collected from workshops
and interviews were conducted. Results showed that students had a general awareness
about environmental issues but lacked awareness about LCA, pollution, and wetlands.
Additionally, the participatory game design process showed that students struggled
with applying the newly gained understandings of LCA in the game designs. The participatory
game design provided a wealth of information on students' understanding and also served
as an effective platform for knowledge elicitation.},

abstract = {This paper presents the findings of two case studies concentrating on the learning
experiences of disadvantaged middle school children participating in The Science and
Art of Game Design (SAGD) and Globaloria, learning environments intended to teach
skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, through educational game
design within informal and school-based settings.In SAGD, youth are introduced to
the STEM principles underlying modern computer games through a two-part curriculum
that takes a reverse engineering approach to educational game design. It begins with
Gamestar Mechanic, a web-based role-playing game that encourages students to think
of games as systems made up of game-specific components and principles that are learned
by playing games, repairing dysfunctional games, and creating new ones for sharing
and critique in an online communities [1]. The second part encourages them to learn
to use these design principles and apply them to solving of problems requiring computational
thinking [2] within the design of games centered on STEM subjects using Microsoft
Kodu, a Microsoft 3D game creation tool.Globaloria is a learning environment designed
for middle school classrooms where students learn STEM concepts in the process of
learning to design computer games using the Adobe Flash platform. Globaloria classrooms
are designed around constructionist pedagogies, and feature a project-based curriculum
supported by a framework of Web 2.0 technologies, and an online community of school
classrooms, educators, and professional game designers.Using multimodal content and
discourse analysis, the study examined the evolution of students' STEM learning and
literacy in these two contexts, as a function of their changes in language use, design
strategies, and game artifact production. Findings suggest that scaffolded game design
can provide an effective context for students to develop deep understandings and engagement
with STEM subjects, in forms valued within the 21st century workplace.},

abstract = {Games are an important part of popular culture and have successfully engaged audiences
from different age groups [8]. This has caused many educators to start thinking of
different ways to infuse game-based techniques (playing or construction) to enhance
education. Over the past five years, there has been several research efforts on curriculum
development and the evaluation of game construction and playing methods to promote
STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) concepts to middle and high
school students. In this paper, we report on a new study following the lead of previous
efforts. In particular, we were granted a block within Frank Hurt High School by the
Surrey school district for which to develop a game construction-based curriculum as
a basis for computer science education within the school, replacing a traditional
computer science class. From February till June 2011 students were taught elementary
programming using GameMaker, a digital game development tool. In addition to collecting
students' overall impressions, we also evaluated students' technical competency (using
tests) and self-efficacy (using surveys) at the start and end of the semester. Our
findings show that the curriculum had a positive, statistically significant effect
on concept comprehension, which suggests that the curriculum was effective for understanding
computer science and game design concepts. In this paper we present the course structure,
methods, and evaluation as a contribution.},

features in their process models, such as the need to design, develop and test software
functionalities. However, while the software engineering (SE) models work successfully
supporting the software development, their practical application for game development
is frequently unsuccessful. To understand this problem and number of other aspects
such as Green IT and business models, we conducted a survey with the game industry
organizations. Based on our observations on the SE practices, the game industry applies
mostly the agile process models or nothing at all, their major concerns for business
were mobile development, digital marketing, employees with specific abilities and
keeping innovation in their business, and their minor concerns were eco-impact elements,
software reusability and financing. Based on our results, we identified areas which
would warrant more studies to support the game industry practices, eco-aspects and

abstract = {Motivation -- Game design and instructional design have to be reconciled in order
to create effective and engaging serious games. However, a methodology for this purpose
is not yet available.Research approach -- Such a methodology should meet two requirements.
It should provide (1) a taxonomy of categories that can be used to describe both information
related to learning objectives (e.g., cognitive skills) and information describing
the dynamics of the game, (2) guidelines to trigger learning naturally in the game.Findings/Design
-- Our proposed methodology comprises two stages. First, a cognitive task analysis
(CTA) is made of the task or the domain that has to be learned. Second, the information
of this analysis has to be integrated with game-related information elements using
our Game Discourse Analysis (GDA). We developed a taxonomy of information elements,
types of relations and aggregates of information elements which form the tools for
the GDA. We showcase the methodology in the domain of triage. In addition, we present
two pilot studies to validate our claims.Research limitations/Implications -- Although
the two pilot studies provide some evidence for our claims, more research is needed.Originality/Value
-- Currently, the community of (serious) games designers lacks an instrument to design
engaging serious games, to communicate about these games and to make comparisons between
serious games. Our methodology fills in this gap.Take away message -- Serious game
design requires a methodology (GDA) that enables designers to describe, visualize,
understand and manipulate the information flow in games in order to create effective
and engaging serious games.},

as landscaping, rivers or road networks, through the use of algorithms, with minimal
input required from the user. In the process of game development, generating terrain
is often an important part of the game development process. Traditional generation
methods are often too time consuming especially with larger terrain maps. On the other
hand, procedural methods that generate terrain automatically often do not have much
user control over the output. We explore the usage of conditional generative adversarial
networks in the creation of road maps, as well as the application of such road maps
in the creation of game levels in game development engines such as Unreal Engine 4.

abstract = {The protection of sensitive information in computer systems and networks from malicious
manipulation is critical. As a key component in cybersecurity, access control is used
to mitigate malicious access to sensitive information. To help students master the
access control concepts, we developed a 2D educational game titled "Temple of Treasures"
that aims to teach Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Access Control List (ACL) and
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) in Unix/Linux Systems via a fun and interactive environment.
The Unity3D game engine is used for game development and the game can be deployed
to multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and web. Player information and in-game
assessment data are saved on the cloud through GameSparks for analysis. The game story
is centered around a group of adventurers in search of gold. The player is stuck in
a temple and has to explore the temple for escape routes. The game has three levels,
where level one focuses on DAC, level two focuses on ACL and the last level is for
MAC. The player has to explore the temple and gain knowledge on targeted concepts
to unlock the gate to the next level. Three in-game assessments have been implemented
to provide immediate feedback for students. The UI Accessibility Plugin (UAP) is used
to make the game accessible to visually impaired players. To scientifically measure
the effectiveness of the game, we developed pre-test, post-test, survey, and focus
group protocols. The game has been used in the Operating Systems class as a homework
assignment at North Carolina A&amp;T State University in spring 2020. This poster will
present the game design and development process, the detailed evaluation plan, and
our initial classroom experience. This portable and self-contained game will make
it easy to share with other faculty engaged in cyber security teaching and research.},

and perception of agile game development in New Zealand. The results show that while
studios universally state and perceive that they use the agile framework Scrum and
sometimes Kanban, their actual practices often differ from these frameworks in key
areas. Furthermore, studios collectively overestimated their level of adherence with
Scrum. This has general implications for related academic studies as well as for the

most recent addition to such games. We include a gameplay and reflection component
in our group-based project course and perform a quantitative analysis of a team management
and leadership aspects that the students encountered during their gameplay. We further

abstract = {Context. Over the last several decades, computer games started to have a significant
impact on society. However, although a computer game is a type of software, the process
to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual features. In software
testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance of professionals to use
automated testing techniques with games, due to the constant changes in requirements
and design, and pointed out the need for creating testing tools that take into account
the flexibility required for the game development process. Goal. This study aims to
improve the current body of knowledge regarding these theme and point out the existing
particularities observed in software testing considering the development of a computer
game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case study and a survey was applied
to collect quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners regarding the particularities
of software testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted
on three well-established network of question-and-answer communities and received
answers of 38 practitioners, and identified important aspects to be observed in the
process of planning, performing and reporting tests games. Conclusion. Considering
computer games, software testing must focus not only on the common aspects of a general
software, but also, track and investigate issues that could be related to game balance,
game physics and entertainment related-aspects to guarantee the quality of computer
games and a successful testing process.},

abstract = {Game analytics is a domain that focuses on the systems and methods used to analyze
game-related data. In this paper we present how a visual game analytic tool can be
developed to analyze player gameplay behavior. Our tool, Data Cracker, was built for
monitoring gameplay in Dead Space 2, the latest game in the Dead Space franchise.
We use Data Cracker as a case study to inform a larger discussion of designing a visual
game analytic tool while working with a game team. Our design approach focuses on
increasing the data literacy of a game team. This means getting an entire team interested
and involved with game analytics. We found that building our tool during the early
game development cycle, creating multiple early visual prototypes and branding the
tool to the Dead Space team caused more team members to become interested in our tool.
Increasing interest in analytics is also a means, we argue, for changing the common
occurrence within the game industry to disband teams after a game is released. Instead,
we promote the creation of "live" teams which stay attached to a game long after it
is release in order to continue the analysis process. Additionally, we discuss the
barriers one might face when developing game analytic tools, such as prejudice against
analytics or the technical issues involved when collecting large data sets. All of
these examples are presented as insights we gained while coupling analytic tool design
to game development.},

fun and easy to learn. In education, two separate tracks of game-based learning and
gamification have sought to activate the benefits of games and game design for the
sake of better learning. This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of games
and gamification to propose an approach that focuses not on motivating with rewards
and consequences, but instead on providing intrinsic game-like experiences through
play. We address the issue of gamifying educational contexts with discussions about
gamer motivations, the relationship between games and play, and designs for optimal
learning within games. From the theoretical foundations of behavioral psychology,
anthropology and game studies, we then conclude with a model for the design and evaluation
of playful experiences in systems of learning inspired by game design.},

abstract = {Current game worlds often fall short in providing consistency between the visual representation
of the world and the way it feels, behaves, and reacts. This problem partly originates
from the goal-oriented and cost-effective nature of the game development process,
which mostly favors ad hoc solutions for one particular game, rather than investing
in concepts like reusability and emergent gameplay. In broader terms, we observe that
game worlds miss semantics, and we argue that its deployment has the potential to
bring about the consistency missing in their content. Therefore, we present a novel
approach aimed at enriching virtual entities in game worlds with information about
their roles, how they relate to others, and how they can affect and interact with
players, NPCs, and with each other. We discuss several requirements to achieve these
goals, and introduce a semantic model to represent game worlds. In order to support
and validate this model, we have developed Entika, a framework to facilitate the deployment
of semantics during game development, as well as its maintenance during run-time.
Furthermore, we briefly discuss several applications that demonstrate the power of
this semantic model for game worlds. After careful evaluation of our semantic game
world model and framework, we conclude that a semantically rich world representation
can substantially assist designers in creating much more consistent game worlds.},

important activity that is used to validate requirements from players' perspective.
Play-testers are not professionals that are involved in the process of RE. They are
not professional testers, either. Yet, their feedback in terms of perceptions and
experiences of the early prototypes of a game, have a decisive impact on what the
RE-professionals do next in the RE process. This position paper presents a qualitative
study that sought to discover who takes the role of play-testers and what kind of
feedback play-testers generate in the early stages of RE for games. The case study
responds to the observation that no textbook on RE or software engineering addresses
play-testing as a phenomenon, and that classic Computer Science programs at universities
teach testing techniques mostly in the context of embedded systems, hence students
often are left with little opportunity to develop testing skills that build upon play-testing
practices happening in the game development sector. The study therefore was aimed
at identifying important implications that play-testing may have for research and
teaching.},

means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related

mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games,
gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this
mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge
areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that
"Software Process", "Software Design" and "Profession Practice" are the most recurring
knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education.
We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods.},

design and inspires confidence. This agile software engineering practice suggests
a different programming way that requires writing tests before writing the code in
short cycles to reduce feedbacks loops. To help novice programmers discover and appreciate
it, this paper describes an experience based on a laboratory course for learning TDD
by developping a Space Invaders game through a step-by-step project-driven approach.
To improve student engagement, a game development is chosen. All concepts are taught
within the context of this project and students learn by doing. Applied in the context
of a basis of object-oriented design course, this experience should raise student
awareness of design's and programming's good practices as testing, refactoring, simple
design and short releases. The evaluation shows that this experience helps students
to engage in the learning process, to reflect on the importance of testing in a software
development, to make aware of code quality and to understand the benefits of TDD.},

to academic fields including software engineering in recent years. Some studies show
that gamification can motivate engineers in Software Engineering (SE) if applied appropriately.
However, most gamification implementations are lacking well-defined frameworks or
models.This paper develops a software gamification model (SGM) with a well-defined
framework that provides a robust process for implementing gamification for SE. This
model also contains elements from applied psychology, Social Software Engineering
(SSE), and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). Having those elements ensures that
the model has a solid foundation in gamification and SE disciplines. The model is
further tailored for cross-cultural software development teams (CCSDT).CCSDT have
been popular in recent years due to the fact that software development has become
a global business. However, as more and more CCSDT are formed, many challenges and
issues have been raised in those cross-cultural environments stemming from miscommunication,
misunderstanding, cultural differences and conflicts. This paper uses the SGM to help
resolve the issues.},

a team's value is determined by its weakest member. The game is represented as an

edge weight along the path; the value of a coalition of edges is the quality of the
best path contained in the coalition, and zero if the coalition contains no such path.
WLGs model joint projects where the overall achievement depends on the weakest component,
such as multiple-option package deals, or transport domains where each road has a
different allowable maximum load.We provide methods for computing revenue sharing
solutions in WLGs, including polynomial algorithms for calculating the value of a
coalition, the core, and the least-core. We also examine optimal team formation in
WLGs. Though we show that finding the optimal coalition structure is NP-hard, we provide
an O(log n)-approximation. Finally, we examine the agents' resistance to cooperation

game design to non-game areas to make certain activities more engaging. Education,
with its strong interactivity, fierce competition among individuals/groups and challenges
in high difficulties, which has lots of similarities with game, are supposed to be
the most widely used areas of gamification. The author has 8 years of game designer

abstract = {Gamification is a trending area of research known as the use of game design elements
in non-game contexts. It consists of using elements borrowed from games like points,
badges and leader-boards to motivate employees for using information systems and improve
their performance and productivity. Gamification gave promising results when applied
to different domains like education, health, crowd-sourcing and banking among others.
To implement and deploy gamification systems, different architectures were proposed
to structure these new systems. However, none of these architectures consider the
quality of data exchanged between the different components of the architecture. In
this context, we propose an architectural framework for gamification systems based
on web-sockets technology to guarantee a real time communication to better follow
the behavior of the user. The proposed solution was validated by implementing a prototype
of the communications using web-sockets technique.},

is based on discrete reinforcement learning in a dualistic fashion, encompassing volatile
short-term memory as well as persistent long-term memory that spans across distinct
game iterations. In combination with heuristics that reduce the search space and the
possibility to employ pre-defined situation-dependent action choices, the system manages
to traverse complete playthrough iterations in roughly the same amount of time that
a professional game tester requires for a speedrun. The ICARUS project was developed
at Daedalic Entertainment. The software can be used to generically run all adventure
games built with the popular Visionaire Engine and is currently used for evaluating
daily builds, for large-scale hardware compatibility and performance tests, as well
as for semi-supervised quality assurance playthroughs. The supplementary video depicts
real-time solving with active control and observation via a web control panel.},

to agents is important for designing intelligent interface agents and adaptive user

on human adaptation to such an agent have been done. We propose a human adaptation
model for a two-player game. We prepared an on-line experimental system in which a
participant and an agent play a repeated penny-matching game with a bonus round. We
then conducted experiments in which different opponent agents (human or robot) change
their strategy during the game. The experimental results indicated that, as expected,
there is an adaptation phase when a human is confronted with a change in the opponent
agent's strategy, and adaptation is faster when a human is competing with robot than
with another human.},

To this purpose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad
suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences
between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized
and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers responding
to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as
well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's
requirements.},

abstract = {Engaging students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is critical
to ensure the success of the next generation of scientists and engineers. Given that
97% of American teens play video games, there is a tremendous opportunity to facilitate
interest in STEM topics through the design of engaging learning games. While a growing
number of serious games have been developed for biological science and computer science
learning, few address the communication and technical challenges that arise in cyberinfrastructure
intensive projects, where multiple domain scientists and computer scientists collaborate.
This paper describes empirical data collected during a year-long human centered game
design process, in which design ideas generated by high school students were bridged
with cyberinfrastructure and bioinformatics learning concepts. Our research shows
that "fun" and engaging game elements are well suited for addressing the sociotechnical
aspects of cyberinfrastructure projects. In this research we provide a human centered
game design methodology for science educators and science game designers, as well
as design implications for integrating game-based experiences into the use of large-scale
shared computing resources and services.},

paper presents a reflexive thematic analysis of 21 in-depth interviews with games
industry professionals on their ethical views and experiences in game design and community
management. We identify a number of tensions involved in making ethics-related design
decisions for divided player communities alongside current game design practices that
are concerned with functionality, revenue and entertainment. We then put forward a

abstract = { Prior game researchers mostly focused on designing the ”macro” context which requires
a decent proportion of time to engage and play, from which players may benefit. However,
the demanding time and effort restrict playability during working hours. To our knowledge,
there is little research exploring game design in a manner that enables momentary
detachment from primary work for a mind refreshment and effortlessly resumes the suspended
work after playing. In this paper, we propose a novel micro-game concept that enables
the gamification of micro-breaks within working hours. To examine our concept, we
adapted a conventional water-ring game into an interactive prototype, InterRings,
which empowers users to play with handy objects. Our mixed observational studies and
interviews revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the micro-game concept.
Conclusively, three design guidelines are summarised for future development of micro-games.

abstract = {Serious Educational Games (SEGs) are games that have a purpose that differs from those
for entertainment only. SEGs offer learners practicing what they learnt. The analysis
and design of such games require integrating game design activities with educational
design concepts (such as learning objectives, assessment methods, and educational
content design). In addition, the integration of these domains require interdisciplinary
team. As a result, a clear, concise communication between team members is a difficult
goal to achieve and ambiguity could arise. An ontology, as a domain modeling tool,
could be used as a meta-model to guide a SEG design and the development team, in addition
to bridging the communication gap between the game design and pedagogic domains. There
is little proof that a comprehensive web-enabled SEGs' ontology, which is characterized
by completion, consistency, and reusability, exists. This paper presents our attempt
to build a comprehensive web enabled SEGs ontology that could be exploited in the
era of the semantic web to be shared and reused by the SEGs' development community.

abstract = {The1 videogame development process must focus on the user satisfaction. Failing to
comply with this may jeopardize the success of the videogame, and even put at risk
the owner company. Requirements Engineering is essential to elicit the needs and desires
of the systems' stakeholders involved in the development, purchase and use of the
videogames. The elicited requirements are the basis for the game specification document
which is then the major driver for the construction of the videogame. The success
of a game involves concerns, such as game strategy, plot and goal of the game, attractive
interfaces, efficient algorithms, and, very important, the emotions that the game
triggers on its players. This work focuses exactly on the requirements that specify
the trigger for different types of emotions. Modeling such emotion requirements has
not been much explored, maybe due to the high degree of subjectivity inherent to any
emotion. This work proposes a modeling language to represent and model the requirements
associated with emotions. These models can be analyzed to identify emotions and conflicting
situations in the early stages of the game development.},

review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and
implemented the PUT concept as a two-step VR game design. To validate our approach,
we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with 31 non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated
the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception,
and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both
studies reveal that the PUT approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis
of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment
without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work
can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design

of game scholarship, there has been interest in applying design patterns to aspects
of game design. There are many potential benefits to design pattern approaches, including
generation of frameworks for teaching and communicating about game design and practical
usage in brainstorming ideas and tuning designs. Furthermore, deeper understanding
of the patterns implicit in their games can help designers explore previously unused
ideas and expectations of player behavior.This workshop features presentation of novel
research papers followed by group discussion of emerging issues in the study of design
patterns and games. We received ten paper submissions, of which we accepted six after
a rigorous peer review process. Each paper received a minimum of three reviews. To

abstract = {Identifying the process of participatory design (PD) approach to cater for students'
mutual needs in recognizing their educational game design aspirations for schools
and higher education and applying their game knowledge to the educational game prototype
setting, is very challenging. Previously, we suggested an effective method for students
to develop their educational games based on a particular course. The PD process method
is needed to identify the contributions of the design artifact. Since PD is widely
used in the design of the game prototype and is also placed in the Information System
(IS) field, the typical design science research (DSR) approach is likely the most
suitable. This paper discusses the details of how DSR is utilized for the intended
purpose. This paper is divided into four parts, i.e., 1) the application of DSR in
the IS fields; 2) DSR and the proposed PD process method; 3) the application of the
DSR methodology to PD research; and 4) the conclusion, implications, and future research.
The findings of the study may contribute to an enhanced understanding of the evaluation
of DSR artifacts such as the mentioned PD process and the contribution of a new extended
PD process in the game design process, particularly in a developed country such as
Malaysia.},

an emerging class of applications particularly interesting for children, for whom
the attraction and the health and developmental benefits are clear cut. Implementing
and prototyping such games present non-trivial technical challenges to interaction
and game designers; this hampers iterative prototyping and testing cycles that are
core to user-centred design and game development processes. This insight has motivated
the development of RaPIDO (Rapid prototyping of Physical Interaction Design for Outdoor
games), a prototyping platform for physical computing, targeting interaction designers
with limited electronics or software skills. RaPIDO has been evaluated in a user test,
evaluating RaPIDOs software library, and in a case study involving two designers who
used it to develop outdoor games for children. We illustrate how RaPIDO enabled broader
exploration of the design space and faster iterations than would otherwise be possible,
allowing designers to focus on the core game concepts rather than complex and low-level
engineering issues.},

varied and the subsequent corresponding effects on learning gains, mental model construction
and perceived engagement empirically tested.Findings -- While the game has been successful
in training the triage procedure, the use of auditory guidance cues has led to worse
mental model construction.Research limitations/Implications -- A triage consists of
mostly procedural information, and the empirically tested guidelines are only tested
in one game, making the possibility of generalization to other games and game types
unclear. In addition, only the effects with relatively short play times are measured.Originality/Value
-- Many serious games struggle to effectively convey their instructional material
to the player. Conventional game design practice may even harm serious games; we seek
to measure what works and what doesn't.Take away message -- When designing a serious
game, pay careful attention to how much you task the player, subtle changes can make
a big difference.},

we introduce muse-based game design, an experimental empathic design approach foregrounding

a user research stage focused on learning about the player, the designer forms idiosyncratic
design constraints inspired by and relating to the player, which are then used to
inspire ideation. To understand the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of
this approach, we discuss findings from two years of application of this style of
game design in a Master's-level class of game design students at the IT University

However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken pipeline for CS education.
In response to this problem, we have developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum
based on a strategy to integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum.
This strategy includes opportunities for students to design and program games and
science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach called Computational
Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to measure and correlate computational
thinking skills relevant to game design and simulations. Results from a study with
more than 10,000 students demonstrate rapid adoption of this curriculum by teachers

women, and interest regardless of demographic background.},

abstract = {Game development is one of the fastest growing industries. Since games' success is
mostly related to users' enjoyment, one of the cornerstones of their quality assessment
is the evaluation from the user perspective. According to literature, game scenario
constitutes a key-factor that leads to users' enjoyment. Despite their importance,
scenarios are currently evaluated through heuristics in a subjective way. The aim
of this paper is to develop an objective model (i.e., a set of quality attributes
and metrics) for evaluating game scenarios with respect to users' satisfaction. The
proposed model can be applied to flow charts and character models (i.e., common game
scenario representation mechanisms). To achieve this goal, we: (a) gathered game scenario
characteristics that are related to users' satisfaction, (b) proposed several metrics
for quantifying these characteristics, and (c) performed a case study on three interactive
scenarios to evaluate the model. As a result, we developed a three-level model: the
first level includes high-level characteristics (e.g., interestingness), which are
specified in the second level; the third level maps graph-based metrics to the attributes
of the second level. The results of the empirical validation suggest that in the majority
of the cases, the proposed metrics were strongly correlated with the perceived opinion
of evaluators. The results can be useful to both researchers and practitioners, in
the form of early quality assessment instruments (regarding practitioners) and future
research directions (regarding researchers).},

abstract = { Over the past few years scientific research has opened up to the idea of using digital
games for human-based studies. Fields such as Neuroscience, Medical and Affective
Computing are currently using games to study human-based phenomena. Even though a
vast amount of work exists within the field, rarely is the subject of designing such
games ever touched upon. In fact a common problem within the field is that the games
themselves are often an afterthought, where certain gameplay limitations are never
truly acknowledged and tend to be mostly ignored. Thus, this paper intends to provide
some game design guidelines to the most common problems found in literature from work
specifically using games for human physiological data-collection purposes. Furthermore,
a brief description of the most popular physiological recording methods: Skin Conductance
(SC), Heart-Rate Variability (HRV), Electromyogram (EMG), Electroencephalogram (EEG)
and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); are provided as the game-play “limitations”
of using such devices are an important factor to take into consideration in the game
design process. As such, the objective of this paper is to provide awareness of specific
game design limitations found in literature and analyse them from a game design perspective.},

has yet to agree on practices and methods for examining game design that are simultaneously

and sufficiently knowledgeable of computation to engage with the materiality of games.In
this paper, we outline such an approach. We focus on the question of an appropriate
method for an academic game design research practice that is grounded in making and
play while respecting recoverability and context. We demonstrate what game analysis
based on such a method can reveal, drawing on the case of Pippin Barr's It is as if
you were doing work, and show how method and analysis in tandem can materialise tacit
design knowledge, support balanced subjectivity, and illuminate the often abstract
design problem space.},

abstract = {With the popularity of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and Virtual Reality
(VR) technologies, VR-MMOGs are developing quickly, demanding ever faster gaming interactions
and image rendering. In this paper, we identify three main challenges of VR-MMOGs:
(1)a stringent latency requirement for frequent local view change responses, (2) a
high bandwidth requirement for constant refreshing, and (3)a large scale requirement
for a large number of simultaneous players. Understanding that a cloud-centric gaming
architecture may struggle to deliver the latency/bandwidth requirements, the game
development community is attempting to leverage edge cloud computing. However, one
problem remains unsolved: how to distribute the work among the user device, the edge
clouds, and the center cloud to meet all three requirements especially when users
are mobile.In this paper, we propose a hybrid gaming architecture that achieves clever
work distribution. It places local view change updates on edge clouds for immediate
responses, frame rendering on edge clouds for high bandwidth, and global game state
updates on the center cloud for user scalability. In addition, we propose an efficient
service placement algorithm based on a Markov decision process. This algorithm dynamically
places a user's gaming service on edge clouds while the user moves through different
access points. It also co-places multiple users to facilitate game world sharing and
reduce the overall migration overhead. We derive optimal solutions and devise efficient
heuristic approaches. We also study different algorithm implementations to speed up
the runtime. Through detailed simulation studies, we validate our placement algorithms
and also show that our architecture has the potential to meet all three requirements
of VR-MMOGs.},

for project management training, simulation games are helpful. Students can try out
different management strategies and gain experience without endangering real projects.
To provide a good learning environment, it is important to simulate the employees
managed by the player as realistically as possible. However, existing approaches only
use simple models to simulate human behavior, missing psychological aspects like motivation
and interpersonal interaction, and therefore are not detailed enough for leadership
and project management training. We present a new decision-making model based on findings
of psychology, which can be used for simulating a more realistic human behavior. We
use heuristics for calculating the motivational force of all potential actions an
employee has, in order to decide which he will choose. This calculation is not only
based on the project's state and schedule, but also on emotional factors like the
preferences and aversions of the employee. Within our approach, we implemented a decision-making
model, which is not limited to our game concept and can also be adapted for other
simulation games.},

abstract = {Interaction with nature in virtual reality has been shown to induce similar restorative
benefits as interaction with real-life nature. Drawing from Attention restoration
theory, restorative benefits from being in virtual nature are likely to be improved
through greater active engagement techniques with specific virtual natural features.
Gamification is the process of adding game design elements in non-game scenarios in
order to improve engagement and motivation. In the present pilot study, six participants
completed either a gamified interaction with virtual nature, one where game design
elements had been added in order to improve engagement with specific virtual nature
features and thus possibly further facilitating sustained attention and self-reported
restoration, having them pick plants and gain rewards such as a higher level in return,
or a non-gamified task, one where they explored the virtual nature environment and
looked at plants at their own pace without any game design elements. Gamified interaction
improved sustained attention restoration more than non-gamified interaction. Additionally,
gamified interaction was also shown to have reduced negative effect in self-reported
restoration more than non-gamified interaction. While there are still several limitations,
gamified interaction with virtual nature seems to offer vast potential as an engagement
technique in improving sustained attention and self-reported restoration.},

abstract = {A documentary film, US AND THE GAME INDUSTRY (2012) comes to you as curious field
research into some works by touted international independent games developers. Three
years in the making it focuses on 2D and 3D aesthetic. The games are at the more succinct
end of game design scales. Set within minimal systems adherence or within seeming
new phases of game asceticism, the film sustains inquiry into design purpose and the
principles of dynamic play.There are five developers featured. Their games are deliverable
to PC/Mac, Play Station 3, the I-pad or I- phone, the DS and for server supported
play. All are high caliber participants in computer science and conceptual thinking,
born near the early 1980's. They carry with them expansive formative experience with
computer game forms. They attended American universities; Cornell, North Western,
Stanford, USC and Parsons; one recently graduated with a Phd at IT, Copenhagen. One
American resident is Chinese born. A fifth developer is born and educated in Australia.
For this group familiarity with algorithms and decades of temporal lives with computers
for play was the norm. These characters as a social group who have not only experienced
thousands of hours with rules of play but are players as consumers who have now switched
to development. They were challenged by boredom and by opportunity, who, ignoring
other explosions such as gamification trends, set off to wield connoisseur status
and provide elegant ideas for universal appeal. They, against the tide of 'the market',
are almost recluses for months and years repeatedly so as to focus individual attention
on the complexity of code, the exquisite natures of flow and games' potentials for
human satisfactions.Robin Hunicke is Executive Producer of JOURNEY.(thatgamecompany)
and Jenova Chen is creative director. This company's latest game is an adventure game
held to the form of a mono myth. Zach Gage (SpellTower) is a concept artist and a
relative newcomer to games design. SpellTower is a word game trumping word games.
Alexander Bruce (Demruth) has been working five years on one adventure experience
for the mind, Antichamber. It uses non- ecludiean geometry. Douglas Wilson (Die Gute
Fabrik), is producing a swamp opera this year titled MUTAZIONE. Jason Rohrer, developer
of short games these last four years is to reveal his next game, THE CASTLE DOCTRINE
in the film.These developers and their retinues stand as unique in their investment
in one --off game development. Their works represent the edge of critical review.
This cluster is a brief representation of people making games sophisticated enough
that many are taking pause with them in the ride of life and cultural selection. Their
scrutiny and \'{e}lan with dynamism, puzzles, myth and story speak of riches to be tackled
and felt.The filmed subjects are presented in interviews, with their work and in dialogues
with some peers. Other designers and developers in support are: Richard Lemarchand
and Nicholas Fortugno. Also, Austin Wintory, composer for JOURNEY and designers and
engineers of the JOURNEY team active during 2009--2012.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the development of a taxonomy of software instruments
that will facilitate the management and evaluation of the design of video games for
education. For that reason, we aim to propose such a taxonomy that will be useful
to users (especially to designers/creators) in the processes of the creation of educational
video games. The proposed taxonomy aims to provide instruments for the facilitated
straightforward design of the video games for education; facilitate the processes
of creation and evaluation of specific video games for educational purposes; and facilitate
non-ICT people such as educators, trainers, teachers in the game-based-learning process.
We propose the following taxonomy named Taxonomy of Instruments for Management and
Evaluation of the Design of Video Games for Education (TIMED-VGE). The suggested taxonomy
includes various software instruments that will be a significant advantage for stakeholders
of educational video games. The taxonomy includes two categories of instruments. The
first category includes instruments supporting/assisting the processes of design management
and its validation, and game generation. The second category presents analytics instruments
for game design evaluation, monitoring, processing, analyzing and visualizing all
the available data. The proposed taxonomy recommends the appropriate instruments to
include in the design, development, and application of video games for education.
Therefore, this taxonomy can serve as a starting point or as guidance for professionals
(software developers, researchers) in the processes of creation of games and video
game platforms for education. In this paper, we describe how the proposed taxonomy
is applied in the APOGEE (smArt adaPtive videO GamEs for Education) software platform
for the creation and monitoring of educational video games. We use the taxonomy to
guide the development of the main platform instruments including both assistive and
analytics instruments. The application of the proposed taxonomy in the APOGEE platform
will be used to validate it. This will contribute to a better understanding of the
game, rapid absorption of educational content, enhanced gaming experience, and for
improving the overall game-based learning process. Thus, the taxonomy will be proved
as a means for designing future software platforms for game-based learning.},

abstract = {Open video game development systems provide a useful model for designing an engaging
user experience (UX) research project. While UX research has typically framed people
simultaneously as research subjects and users of a technology, some work has also
problematized each of these categorizations. For instance, UX practitioners have questioned
the framing of people as generic users, and participatory design has repositioned
participants as co-owners of the results of research. This article offers a complimentary
perspective by applying the concept of user roles to the activity of participation
in open development. Open development, which is the prolonged process where incomplete
games are publicly released and iterated on based on player feedback, is fundamentally
a UX research process. In open development projects, user-participants adopt a variety
of roles, including acting as consumers, players, bug reporters, player support services,
community moderators, reviewers, developer advocates, playtesters, quality assurance
testers, content creators, and ideators. This paper builds definitions for the user-participant
roles and offers examples from the online forums for an open development game. Finally,
it argues that we can design communications systems to support these roles.},

on informant design methods, the proposed approach aims to maximize the contribution
of both children informants and adult designers. It comprises of three major phases,
namely Narrative Design, Game Design and Design Moderation. A mobile phone game was
developed based on this approach. User testing revealed that the children generally
enjoyed the game and that the proposed approach has promising potential in empowering
the child designers. Future work will focus on further evaluation of the approach

had an exponential grown in the last decade, its use in novel therapies for motor

as a complementary therapy for neuromuscular disorders, being the game design process
a key factor to influence both the attractiveness and effectiveness of the game. In
this paper, we expose a design methodology used for the creation of a serious videogame
for motor rehabilitation of upper limbs using surface electromyography (sEMG) as the
human-computer interface to control the game and monitor the players' fatigue levels.
By using an adaptation mechanism from the physiological computing field, called biocybernetic
adaptation; the videogame can adapt the game difficulty based on measured fatigue
levels. The game design was also informed with therapeutic recommendations and followed
an iterative design process. We hope this paper can reveal important insights for
both engineers and game designers to create more physiologically intelligent solutions

the motivation to start and continue to play the game. To gain insight into which
game experiences can be evolved by the game, designers have been using PLEX cards
in the user input phase or in the product evaluation phase of the design process.
However, to our knowledge, no research has been conducted to check if the PLEX gathered
design input experiences matches the experiences that are evolved by the game in the
final design. This study checks if such a use of PLEX is possible in a game design
procedure for youngsters in treatment for drug addiction. Youngsters firstly selected
their preferred PLEX experiences. Secondly, a game designer created a prototype based
on the user's motivating experiences and a prototype based on the user's least motivating
experiences. Thirdly, other youngsters from the addiction clinic evaluated both prototypes
by selecting the PLEX cards that matched their game experiences best. Results suggested
that motivating PLEX experiences resulted in a better tailored prototype. However,
PLEX experiences derived in the user input phase could not be matched one-on-one to
the ones in the evaluation phase. This can problematize the usage of PLEX as a general
tool for experience-based game design.},

Interactive Computing Systems -- EICS'12 held in Copenhagen (25--28 June 2012). EICS
is an international conference devoted to all aspects of engineering usable and effective
interactive computing systems. Topics of interest include multi-device interactive
systems, new and emerging modalities (e.g., gesture), entertaining applications (e.g.,
mobile and ubiquitous games), safety critical systems (e.g. medical devices), and
design and development methods (e.g., extreme programming).EICS focuses on tools,
techniques and methods for designing and developing interactive systems. The conference
brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems,
drawing from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Software Engineering, Requirements
Engineering, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Ubiquitous &amp; Pervasive Systems,
Game Development, and Cognitive Engineering communities. The conference is the legatee
of a number of conferences and workshops series: EHCI (Engineering Human Computer
Interaction), DSV-IS (International Workshop on the Design, Specification and Verification
of Interactive Systems), CADUI (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design
of User Interfaces) and TAMODIA (International Workshop on Task Models and Diagrams).Since
its beginning EICS has witnessed a growing number of submissions. This year the program
contains 21 full papers carefully chosen from a total of 95 submissions (22% acceptance
rate). There are also 12 late breaking papers (five of which presented as posters)
as well as a number of doctoral reports, workshop reports, tutorial abstracts and
demonstration descriptions. The published material originates from 15 countries, including
New Zealand, North and South America, and Europe. In addition, keynote addresses will
be offered by Robert Jacob (Tufts University, USA) and Jakob Bardram (IT University
of Copenhagen, Denmark).We believe that for this fourth EICS edition we obtained an
exciting and interactive program, which stimulates fruitful discussion in the relevant
research fields. Topics range from model-based approaches to the design, analysis
and generation of user interfaces, to toolkits supporting their development. A diversity
of interaction styles and application areas is covered including multimodal, multidevice
or multi-touch interfaces, ubiquitous computing, and health.We hope that you will
find this year program interesting and thought provoking. The symposium aims to provide
you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners
from institutions around the world. We also wish the best to the next edition, EICS
2013 to be held in London, UK, in June 2013.},

abstract = {Game-based second language (L2) learning represents an ideal alternative to foreign
language classroom instruction. However, despite a diverse player demographic, the
design of L2 games is often not informed by players representative of marginalized
populations, especially women of color (i.e., Black women). Such oversight in the
design process contributes to games that perpetuate gendered and racist stereotypes,
and therefore, are less appealing to women of color. In response this dilemma, we
utilize Black Feminist Thought (BFT) as a critical framework to engage Black women,
a marginalized and understudied population within the gaming subculture, and more
broadly, the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) community in game design.
Twenty-five Black women take on multiple roles as game designers, foreign language
instructor, and informants who represent both producers and consumers throughout the
conceptualization phase of a L2 mobile game prototype. Applying BFT principles, we
leverage Black womentextquotesingle s lived intersectional experiences to transform
the traditional game design process into a more inclusive design experience for Black
women. In the context of games that support L2 learning, our findings reveal that
Black women appreciate games that: 1. provide authentic cultural experiences; 2. feature
intersectional game characters that reflect real life experiences; 3. accurately portray
the diversity of Black women's bodies; and 4. provide opportunities for players to
customize game assets. As a disruptor to traditional game design, BFT makes salient
oppressive design practices within the gaming culture that also extend to the larger
CSCW community, signifying the need to embrace more inclusive design practices that
benefit Black women and other marginalized populations.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG)-based game design aims to reach a new way of playing
games by focusing gameplay around algorithmic game content generation. However, positioning
interaction with PCG systems and generated content to the center of player experience
poses design challenges for both game design and AI design. In order to create the
wanted affordances, rich contextual information is required to make informed decisions
on the generated content. While previous research has presented excellent developments
on PCG’s possibilities, further considering context and affordances in the early stages
of prototyping may aid designers reach these possibilities in a more consistent manner.
This study is set to discuss how context, affordances and the game’s overall design
can be considered during the prototyping process of PCG-based games. Misaligned game
context and affordances can result in deeply rooted design issues that may later manifest
as subpar gameplay experiences and increased development effort. These emergent issues
are examined through a post-mortem case study to produce an extended PCG-based design
process, featuring actionable steps, that takes context, affordances, and the game’s
overall design into account through meaningful play.},

Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) and related "privacy engineering" methodologies
exist and provide clear instructions for developers to implement privacy into software

are not yet a common practice in the software development community. There has been
no previous research focused on developing "educational" interventions such as serious
games to enhance software developers' coding behaviour. Therefore, this research proposes
a game design framework as an educational tool for software developers to improve
(secure) coding behaviour, so they can develop privacy-preserving software applications
that people can use. The elements of the proposed framework were incorporated into
a gaming application scenario that enhances the software developers' coding behaviour
through their motivation. The proposed work not only enables the development of privacy-preserving
software systems but also helping the software development community to put privacy
guidelines and engineering methodologies into practice.},

it has become a mainstay of game AI, with significant research being put towards the
investigation of new PCG systems, algorithms, and techniques. But for PCG to be absorbed
into the practice of game design, it must be contextualised within design-centric
as opposed to AI or engineering perspectives. We therefore provide a set of design
metaphors for understanding potential relationships between a designer and PCG. These
metaphors are: tool, material, designer, and domain expert. By examining PCG through
these metaphors, we gain the ability to articulate qualities, consequences, affordances,
and limitations of existing PCG approaches in relation to design. These metaphors
are intended both to aid designers in understanding and appropriating PCG for their
own contexts, and to advance PCG research by highlighting the assumptions implicit
in existing systems and discourse.},

proposes a theoretical approach to study the key factors leading to successful online

Model (PAAM) for conciseness, linking the antecedents into the key factors using information
acquired from an extended literature review. We then undertook a survey of 201 online
gamers to investigate key factors affecting players' acceptance of online games. Through
structural equation modeling, our findings showed that the “perceived benefits” construct
is dependent on whether online games met gamers' goals for entertainment or leisure
activities, in-game experiences, and out-game needs, while the “perceived ease of
use” construct is determined by game design and facilitating conditions. We believe
our theoretical model and results are useful to designers and developers of software
companies when creating online games that will satisfy gamers' goals, in-game experiences,
and out-game needs for playability.},

abstract = {In contemporary game development circles the 'game making jam' has become an important
rite of passage and baptism event, an exploration space and a central indie lifestyle
affirmation and community event. Game jams have recently become a focus for design
researchers interested in the creative process. In this paper we tell the story of
an established local game jam and our various documentation and data collection methods.
We present the beginnings of the current project, which seeks to map the creative
teams and their process in the space of the challenge, and which aims to enable participants
to be more than the objects of the data collection. A perceived issue is that typical
documentation approaches are 'about' the event as opposed to 'made by' the participants
and are thus both at odds with the spirit of the jam as a phenomenon and do not really
access the rich playful potential of participant experience. In the data collection
and visualisation projects described here, we focus on using collected data to re-include
the participants in telling stories about their experiences of the event as a place-based
experience. Our goal is to find a means to encourage production of 'anecdata' - data
based on individual story telling that is subjective, malleable, and resists collection
via formal mechanisms - and to enable mimesis, or active narrating, on the part of
the participants. We present a concept design for data as game based on the logic
of early medieval maps and we reflect on how we could enable participation in the
data collection itself.},

pervasive game projects commonly do not enable relocation of the game space while
also overlooking several aspects which critically affect user acceptance and game

game. Barbarossa addresses the abovementioned issues featuring several portable game
modes. It also takes into account concrete technology usage requirements for each
game mode according to the game session duration and player effort required. Further,
game experience is enhanced through incorporating several contextual parameters. User
evaluation trials indicated warm reception of Barbarossa by players and confirmed
that the main game design objectives have been largely achieved.},

at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), an HBCU. Nationally, many gaming concentration
programs in the CS curriculum have been successfully developed. Nevertheless, to our
knowledge, none has been established at any of the HBCUs. The proposed gaming concentration
aims to educate minority students with the skills necessary to participate as computer
scientists in a game development team and other software development projects. The
concentration will help the enrollment and retention of underrepresented students
and increase the quality of graduates in this field. A successful gaming concentration
at WSSU will advance the knowledge in developing curricula for HBCUs and other minority
institutions.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking,
crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory
innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely,
unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur"
end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to
explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance
of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier
end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied
group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the
dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation.
Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face,
therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists'
and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users
who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology
and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven
technological practices.},

its commercial viability and impact on product success. This gap in understanding
is further complicated by the vague definition of "success" afforded by sales figures

titles by analyzing playtesting reports and game reviews. By comparing themes and
design issues expressed in game reviews to the results of pre-release playtesting
for each game, we aim to highlight the value of playtesting and propose a set of guidelines
for selecting playtest methods based on the needs of a given game evaluation. Through
the real-world case studies presented, this paper contributes to the growing domain
of games user research and highlights the value of playtesting in game development.},

abstract = {Cumulus cloud scene is essential in many applications like movie production and 3D
game development. Realistic clouds with variant shapes are critical to enhancing the
quality of virtual scenes. Therefore, many methods for constructing cumulus cloud
scene have been proposed. However, current methods either require professional knowledge
on modeling procedures and parameter adjusting, or only generate repetitive cloud
shapes. It is a huge project even for experienced users to construct realistic cumulus
cloud scene. Thus, it becomes a difficult task for novice users like movie producers
and game designers. To address this problem, we propose a sketch-based retrieval system
from pre-generated cumulus cloud models for cumulus cloud scene construction. In order
to get realistic clouds, we first generate 3D cloud models from natural images, and
construct a 3D cloud model database. Then the user is provided with an intuitive sketch
interface for retrieving a cloud model with the desired shape and placed it at the
desired position. Instead of retrieving 3D cloud volumes directly via 2D sketches,
our method uses natural images in the database as index thus retrieval procedure is
more robust and efficient. Our method allows novice users to intuitively design the
desired and realistic cumulus cloud scene.},

abstract = {Computer games are complex products incorporating software, design and art. Consequently,
their development is a multidisciplinary effort, requiring professionals from several
fields, who should nonetheless be knowledgeable across disciplines. Due to the variety
of skills required, and in order to train these professionals, computer game development
(GD) degrees have been appearing in North America and Europe since the late 1990s.
Following this trend, several GD degrees have emerged in Portugal. Given the lack
of specialized academic staff, not uncommon in younger scientific areas, some of these
degrees "borrowed" computer science (CS) programs and faculty within the same institution,
leading in some cases to a disconnect between CS theory and practice and the requirements
of GD classes. In this paper, we discuss our experience in adapting the CS curriculum
of a three-year computer games BA in accordance with GD requirements. We used a top-down
approach, where the game engine used for GD informs the choice of CS topics and programming
languages lectured in the CS curriculum. The discussion is centered around the choices
taken and the theoretical and empirical rationale behind our decisions. Preliminary
empirical results indicate a substantial increase in GD project quality and a clear
improvement in the students' technical skills, as well as in their experimentation
and adaptation capabilities.},

abstract = {Even though the digital age is so advanced around the globe, nowadays Mexico does
not have necessary conditions for any institution to use fully automated tools. Disadvantages
such as poor infrastructure, lacking computers, and inadequate internet access are
some of the most common obstacles that do not allow for the most of the Mexican educational
institutions to use automated techno-pedagogical strategies. In this work, we propose
a semi-automated tool, based on tangible user interfaces and apply gamification, for
teaching algebra. The major challenge of this project is the context of use, where
the proposal was initially valued using statistical experimental designs through a
hypothesis test and a regression analysis. In both, a longitudinal study with two
measures at different times of a related sample, composed of 19 students, is considered.
In the hypothesis test the difference between the before and after of application
of an instructional design with the game management through the gamified board was
contrasted, obtaining as a result that the average in the ability to solve problems
in the pre-test is of 0.1184 and in the post-test of 0.5586, therefore, the difference
between means, before and after the instructional design allows to accept the hypothesis
that if there are changes in the ability to solve problems of algebra, before and
after the use of the gamified board. The regression analysis allows us to state that
16.9% of the ability to solve algebra problems can be influenced by the number of
activities that the student performs with the gamified board.},

difficult tasks more engaging. However, with serious game design being a relatively
nascent field, such experiences can still be hard to learn and not very motivating.
In this paper, we explore the use of learning and motivation frameworks to improve
player experience in the well-known citizen science game Foldit. Using Cognitive Load
Theory (CLT) and Self Determination Theory (SDT), we developed six interface and mechanical
changes to the tutorial levels in Foldit designed to increase engagement and retention.
We tested these features with new players of Foldit and collected both behavioral
data, using game metrics, and prior experience data, using self-report measures. This
study offers three major contributions: (1) we document the process of operationalizing
CLT and SDT as new game features, a unique methodology not used in game design previously;
(2) the user interface, specifically the level selection screen, significantly impacts
how players progress through the game; and (3) a player's expertise, whether from
prior domain knowledge or prior gaming experience, increases their engagement. We
discuss both implications of these findings as well as how these implementations can
generalize to other designs.},

abstract = {Games can serve as a valuable tool for enriching computer science education, since
they can facilitate a number of conditions that can promote learning and instigate
affective change. As part of the 22nd ACM Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology
in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2017), the Working Group on Game Development
for Computer Science Education convened to extend their prior work, a review of the
literature and a review of over 120 educational games that support computing instruction.
The Working Group builds off this earlier work to design and develop a prototype of
a game grounded in specific learning objectives. They provide the source code for
the game to the computing education community for further review, adaptation, and
exploration. To aid this endeavor, the Working Group also chose to explore the research
methods needed to establish validity, highlighting a need for more rigorous approaches
to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of games in computer science education. This
report provides two distinct contributions to the body of knowledge in games for computer
science education. We present an experience report in the form of a case study describing
the design and development of If Memory Serves, a game to support teaching pointers

abstract = {Giving presents can have a positive impact upon the giver's mental well-being [1-4].
We wonder whether giving a present to an AI agent could have the same effect. We investigate
this question in the context of video games with non-player characters (NPCs), because
the rapid expansion of the game industry makes NPCs one of the most common ways in
which we experience AI agents. We seek to understand whether players benefit mentally
by giving gifts to NPCs in video games. We intend to observe the behaviour of players
and measure their psychological changes through a specially designed video game providing
them with mechanisms for gifting to NPCs. We have taken an understanding of gifting
from the real world and applied this understanding within a game. The game development
has been an iterative process of design-build-playtest. Such a process helps us better
understand the research space and to better describe the questions. This article reports
the latest findings from the game development after playtesting with 12 participants.},

Load Theory and fundamental digital game design principles of flow, skill progression,

and run through stages of design and review against the initial goals in iterative
loops until passing on to final implementation.Given known variables of target audience
skill, quantifiable difficulty measurements for existing gameplay, and the desired
skills taught and tested, designers can use this process to analyze and adjust gameplay
for increased accessibility. By controlling the difficulty of gameplay, designers
ensure that players are able to learn and practice skills adequately, laying the foundation
for further in-game and real-world challenges. While this article focuses on educational
games and adult literacy, this process is broadly applicable to any educational or
entertainment games that desire greater control over gameplay curve progression.},

number of projects do not have rigorous Pedagogical foundations. Additionally, many
existent educational game design frameworks have a one-size-fits-all approach. That
is, they were conceived with a single domain of knowledge in mind or do not consider
the personal characteristics of those involved in the learning process. To address
these issues, we reviewed multiple case studies and design frameworks, and studied
guidelines from Pedagogy. As a result, using techniques from Grounded Theory, we identified
key design patterns and features present in educational games that may serve to attain
learning goals. With this information, we created a model to analyze existing games

Serious Games - Serious Games'14.This workshop brings together researchers, developers
and users of serious games. The worldwide interest in games has grown tremendously
over the last years. Popular games have millions of users. With the growing data rate
available to end users and the increasing CPU power of mobile devices, online and
collaborative games are getting especially attractive. Games are also a relevant economic
factor, a prospering market. They tackle a diversity of computer science research
aspects, e.g., computer graphics, artificial intelligence, user interfaces and sensors,
authoring and software production, human computer interaction, usability and user
experience.On the other side, game research is still in its beginning. This is especially
true for the field of Serious Games: Here, game aspects are combined with additional
technologies/concepts and 'applied' to fulfill an additional purpose beyond pure entertainment
(e.g., a learning, training or health effect, a behavior change in the daily lifestyle,
or awareness about socially relevant topics such as politics, religion, security or
energy). This nature of Serious Games results in a highly complex and interdisciplinary
environment, requiring research and development methodologies beyond technology. For
instance, in the field of games for health, domain experts such as doctors, sport
scientists, therapists, etc. are involved apart from game developers and suppliers
and end users (players, patients).The call for papers attracted 17 submissions from
Asia, Europe, and the United States. Each paper has been reviewed by three to four
members of the program committee. The PC accepted ten papers (~59%). The workshop
format is intended to be very interactive. All authors are encouraged to present their
research outcomes enhanced by game demonstrations. Further, moderated discussion rounds
tackle the underlying research and technical development RTD aspects of the three
workshop sessions on Serious Game Development, Serious Games in Health and Serious
Games in Education, Training and Culture. We also encourage the participants to attend
the invited talk on The Five Most Important Research Issues in Effective Game Design

us in the organization of the course and in the teaching activities.Apart from games
development and game design, students learn modeling, design patterns and software

DDA approaches based on deep learning can shorten the time-consuming tuning process,

fast user adaptation method that can adjust the difficulty of the game for various
players using only a small amount of demo data by applying a meta-learning algorithm.
In the video game environment user test (n=9), our proposed DDA method outperformed

abstract = {Cultural presence is a term used to explain and evaluate cultural learning in virtual
heritage projects but is less frequently used for video games. Given the increasing
importance of video games to cultural heritage, this article investigates explanations
of cultural presence that could be communicated by games, especially concerning UNESCO
and ICOMOS definitions of cultural significance. The aim is to determine if cultural
presence can be communicated via video games and across a range of game genres.Observations
derived from game prototyping workshops for history and heritage aided the development
of a teachable list of desirable game elements. To distinguish itself from the vagueness
surrounding theories of cultural presence, a theory of culturally significant presence
is proposed. Culturally significant presence requires three components: culturally
significant artifacts and practices; an overarching framework of a singular, identifiable
cultural viewpoint; and awareness by the participant of both the culturally significant
and the overarching cultural framework and perspective (which gives sites, artifacts,
and practices their cultural significance and relational value).As awareness of cultural
presence requires time for reflection, single-player games were chosen that were not
completely dependent on time-based challenges. Another criterion was cultural heritage
content: They must simulate aspects of heritage and history, communicate a specific
cultural framework, or explore and reconstruct a past culture. Four games were chosen
that simulate a culture, explain archaeological methods, portray indigenous intangible
heritage, or explain historical-based ecosystems of the past based on educational
guidelines. The games are Assassin's Creed: Origins; Heaven's Vault; Never Alone;
and a Ph.D. project: Saxon. Their genres could be described as first-person shooter/open
world/virtual tour; dialogue-based puzzle game; 2D platform game; and turn-based strategy
game.The aim is not to evaluate the entire range of interactive virtual environments
and games, but to examine the applicability and relevance of this new theory and to
ascertain whether the four games provided useful feedback on the concept and usefulness
of culturally significant presence. A more clearly demarcated theory may not only
help focus evaluation studies but also encourage game developers to modify or allow
modification of commercial games for classroom teaching of digital heritage.},

tools, which hide the complexities of underlying technologies from authors, with the
high levels of interactivity and immersion of digital games. To achieve this goal,
a model for games will be described, which is manipulated in the authoring tool and
executed by the serious game platform developed at the Multimedia Communications Lab.

abstract = {The Game Design activity is often conditioned by pre-existing assumptions of what
constitutes a game and its constituting elements, which can lead to repetitive designs
and all too familiar experiences. In trying to support the education of a new generation
of designers so as to leave the comfort zone of familiar objects, we proposed a design
canvas with six perspectives for which to conceptualize player participation in the
experience. For each perspective, we proposed a set of questions designed to prompt
new lines of thought regarding design intent, game object, and player participation.
The canvases were tested throughout three research iterations and improved based on
qualitative evaluations of their influence in game design learning processes. The
canvas was generally found to be effective at quickly pulling inexperienced game design
participants to consider a variety of innovative play experiences, beyond what we
would expect from derivative design from examples.},

player models for the purpose of tailoring the game experience to the individual player.
The main contribution of the article is a motivation for personalised gaming, supported
by an extensive overview of scientific literature. The motivatin concerns (a) the
psychological foundation, (b) the effect on player satisfaction, (c) the contribution
to game development, and (d) the requirement for achieving ambitions. The provided
overview of scientific literature goes into the subject of player modelling, as well
as eight adaptive components: (1) space adaptation, (2) mission/task adaptation, (3)
character adaptation, (4) game mechanics adaptation, (5) narrative adaptation, (6)
music/sound adaptation, (7) player matching (multiplayer), and (8) difficulty scaling.
In the concluding sections, the relationship to procedural content generation is discussed,
as well as the generalisation to other domains.},

abstract = {Traditional schooling is perceived by many students as ineffective and boring. Although
teachers continuously seek novel instructional approaches, it is largely agreed that
today's schools face major problems around student motivation and engagement. The
use of educational games as learning tools is a promising approach. Games have remarkable
motivational power. They utilize a number of mechanisms to encourage people to engage
with them, often without any reward, just for the joy of playing and the possibility
to win. However, creating a highly engaging, full-blown educational game is difficult,
time consuming and costly and typically targets only a single set of learning objectives
as chosen by the game designer. Yet, the effective classroom adoption of games requires
an appropriate pedagogical integration and sometimes a certain technical infrastructure.
Can we then, instead of using full-scale games, incorporate game thinking and game
design elements in the learning environment as an alternative, less costly and more
flexible approach to improving learners' engagement and motivation? Gamification --
the use of game design elements in non-game contexts -- has already seen a successful
adoption in many areas including business, marketing, politics, health, fitness and
travel. It seems surprising that the education is not in the list of "success stories"
yet. Is this just a matter of late reaction or a wait for more persuasive evidence?
Can gamification be used in an educational context as well and if so, which are the
factors promising success? The talk will explore these questions giving specific attention
to the motivational factors that impact learning and behaviour change and will present
an overview of the current state of the art and the challenges in using gamification
in education.},

game titles released every month, gamers have become more difficult to please and
fickle in their allegiances. Therefore, it would be beneficial if we could forecast
how addictive a game is before publishing it on the market. With the capability of
game addictiveness forecasting, developers will be able to continuously adjust the
game design and publishers will be able to assess the potential market value of a
game in its early development stages.In this paper, we propose to forecast a game's
addictiveness based on players' emotional responses when they are first exploring
the game. Based on the account activity traces of 11 commercial games, we develop
a forecasting model that predicts a game's addictiveness index according to electromyographic
measures of players' two facial muscles. We hope that with our methodology, the game
industry could optimize the odds of successful investments and target more accurately
the provision of a better entertaining experience.},

abstract = {This paper reports on an intervention in introductory Computer Graphics courses, where
practical coursework is transitioned from standard OpenGL Graphics APIs to the Unity
Game Development Engine. Game Development Engines (GDEs) provide powerful programming
tools and computing components. Software development in GDEs is facilitated by full-fledged
IDEs. Complex scene modeling and image rendering are managed through a rich catalogue
of rendering assets. Graphics APIs are evolving towards a lower level of hardware
abstraction, reduced overhead, and multithreading capabilities. Such changes in APIs
benefit software developers who build graphics engines; how much they benefit Computer
Graphics education is yet to be determined. New graphics APIs represent a shift in
graphics programming practices, nearly as big as programmable GPUs and shader-based
APIs over a decade ago. As then, Computer Graphics instructors have to decide: either
use outdated models, or again change how Computer Graphics is taught. This paper describes
an educational approach that acknowledges the increasing divide between the ease of
use and development speed of GDEs, and the complexity and vastness of new graphics
APIs. We show the use of a GDE as software development framework, to support programming
assignments covering core Computer Graphics concepts. Relying on a GDE, such graphics
assignments don't have to shy away from shader-based graphics programming, while non-graphics
low-level tasks are managed by the engine itself. With our approach, we hope to contribute
to the discussion about evolving best practices in teaching Computer Graphics.},

in the collaborative creation of game content. Different mixed-initiative approaches
use different methods to engage with the design material while supporting the designer's

and how to control them. In order to limit miscommunication during the design process,
heuristics could be applied.In this paper we present a mixed-initiative tool for evolving
dungeons with the aid of game design patterns as heuristics. The tool, the Evolutionary
Dungeon Designer, uses a genetic algorithm that searches for levels containing game
design patterns on two hierarchical levels of abstraction to express more complex
gameplay in the game level.We evaluate the tool through a series of lab experiments
and a user study conducted with professional game developers. Our results demonstrate
that we are able to control the generation of the different patterns with the aid
of design pattern-related input parameters, as well as identifying a number of features
a design pattern-based mixed-initiative tool could benefit from.},

may cope well with this situation, elderly or impaired persons in production environments
need context-sensitive assistance.The contribution of the research presented here
is three-fold: (1) We provide a framework for context-aware assistive systems in production
environments. These systems are based on motion recognition and use projection and
elements from game design (gamification) to augment work. (2) Based on this framework
we describe a prototype with respect to both the physical and the software implementation.
(3) We present the results of a study with impaired workers and quantifying the effects

abstract = {Game engines are the most important tools in modern game development. We have developed
a novel game engine CAGE and used it in a game programming course for three years.
The CAGE game engine was developed in summer 2008 in Tampere University of Technology.
It has been developed iteratively since then. In this paper, we describe lessons learned
from the three years of when CAGE has been used. Our experiences can provide valuable
information for teachers planning a use of a game engine in their game programming
classes.},

abstract = {Integrating user-generated content into digital games helps to increase re-usability
and to decrease development effort. In terms of learning games, the content creation
can be extended to the learning parts of the game as well, e.g., allowing teachers
to create custom games for their students. In this work, we propose a method of how
to create learning games with arbitrary user-generated learning content. This includes
not only different topics of learning content, but also different types of knowledge
acquisition. To do this we combine a static game scenario with lightweight HTML5-based
mini games. Learning content can be conveniently added through a web-based authoring
tool that does not require any programming or game design knowledge. In addition to
that, we created a game prototype based on the Unity3D engine that uses a tower defence
game setting to integrate the learning content. These mini games are retrieved from
the backend service at runtime. The implemented solution already allows for the integration
of arbitrary content and can easily extended without altering the game client.},

games. But more than that, these meetings work as an important networking environment
for building social and professional relationships among individuals in the area,
in addition to generating an ecosystem of support favorable to the game development
market, benefiting all those involved: aspirants, professionals and the market as
a whole. For these reasons, participating in game jams has become a relevant factor
for the insertion and consolidation of game professionals in the area. However, it
is noticeable that women still represent a very small percentage in these events.
This work aims to understand the aspects that may be the reason of the lack of female
participation in game development marathons, in order to clarify what are the behaviors
and environments that either promote or discourage female motivation to participate
in game jams. For this purpose, we conducted a case study where we used a mixed method
approach to analyze the influence of gender in different perspectives of a game jam.
We found results such as the motivational aspects for both genders were very similar;
the self-confidence of female participants was lower than male participants; and the
significant increase of female registrations after an advertisement campaign targeting
women.},

game requires players to sort random input objects of particular shapes and colours

collects data about how players engage with the game, such as the time taken and number
of reattempts at each level. The game was tested on a group of 39 electrical engineering
and game design students, many of whom had not programmed before. 80% of participants
completed all 9 levels of the game. The minimum average time for a level was around
20 seconds with an average of 2 attempts, whilst the most difficult level took an
average of 7 minutes over 3 attempts to complete. These results indicate that the
game provided a good, but not overwhelming, challenge for the desired audience. A
survey was used to collect qualitative feedback from the audience. The game was judged
to be both fun and rewarding, but is too instructive and the user interface was deemed
confusing. Further work conducted includes a simple test before and after the game
is played, to judge the effect of the game on students' understanding.},

abstract = { Computer games are a genre of software systems that in many ways differs from more
traditional applications. In particular, when designing games, the end result of game
development resembles work of art rather than that of engineering, emphasizing the
need for creativity and artistic abilities. However, as technology, tools, methods,
and artifacts that are used in the development of games are to a large extent similar
to those used in the development of more traditional system, games should conform
to the basic laws of software, including software evolution. In this paper, we reflect
the principles of software evolution distilled by Manny Lehman in the form of laws
of software evolution to the game domain. We present how the laws can be interpreted
and applied in games projects, and argue that many of the laws apply to many games,
but not all laws apply to all games. The way the game is evolved especially has an
effect on the applicable laws as changes in games can be emerging, reactive or pre-planned.

and intuitive tools and techniques to communicate simulation models with industry

virtual worlds of the simulated construction operations is an effective medium of
communication. However, developing visual behaviors to reflect hidden simulation behaviors
is time consuming. The relatively small time window available for developing and using
simulation models on real construction operations requires a time and cost effective
approach for developing simulation driven visualization. This paper describes an approach
that utilizes an open source gaming engine to develop parallel and loosely coupled

step-by-step approach to document and facilitate application of the same approach

abstract = {Game jams have grown as a democratized game development process, imitating on several
days the production of the AAA-industry. However, the current format of the mainstream
game jams does not give the possibilities to learn how to work in a big production
or to emulate correctly the feeling to be in a big team, because the team size tend
to oscillate between a solo team to maximum ten participants. In countries like Switzerland,
there is no AAA-industry that employs hundreds of developers at the same time. For
those kinds of experience, game developers and game designers have to "export" themselves
out of those countries, making it a harder experience to live.In 2015, the two main
game developers' linguistic communities of Switzerland tried two different experiments
answering this question: "How can we bring together the different talents at disposal
to create one game?". The Swiss-French game developers' community answered with an
indie game jam with a team of 26 developers, the I3 Game Jam. The Swiss-German game
developers' community answered with an academic workshop of three weeks with a pre-defined
game concept, the Swiss Mercenaries Workshop.From those two approaches, the authors
formalize and theorize what is a Big Team Game Jam and their different key elements
compared to standard game jams: Target Group, Hierarchy, Participants Motivation,
Ownership, and Duration. This paper explores those two solutions, their community
context, and gives a framework for countries like Switzerland without a AAA-industry
to emulate those productions at very low-cost.},

point clouds representing the spatiotemporal colour distribution for the objects present
in a sequence of bug-free frames. This is done by converting the position that the
pixels take over time into the 3D equivalent points with associated colours. Once
the space of labelled points is built, each new image produced from the same game
by any rendering system can be analysed by measuring its visual inconsistency in terms
of distance from the database. Objects within the scene can be relocated (manually
or by the application engine); yet the algorithm is able to perform the image analysis
in terms of the 3D structure and colour distribution of samples on the surface of
the object.We applied our framework to the publicly available game RacingGame developed
for Microsoft® Xna®. Preliminary results show how this approach can be used to detect
a variety of visual artifacts generated by the rendering system in a professional

virtual walks while accounting for special needs regarding game complexity, and simplistic
interaction paradigms are provided using Nintendo's Wii Remote and the Balance Board
for game control. Evaluation results suggest that despite age-related impairments,
the game was generally accessible to elderly persons. Yet, differences between inexperienced
and experienced players were observed which suggest that interaction problems may
be reduced by engaging with games over a longer time. Findings also indicate that
the engagement of elderly players transcends into their everyday life, and their social
interaction increases among one another. Most importantly, the evaluation showed that
games were perceived as enjoyable leisure activity, supporting the approach of applying
digital games to raise the quality of life among frail elderly by fostering activity.},

of how to engage with a real-world problem, how to ideate and explore, and how to
iterate and reflect on gameful design. We describe the three methodological cornerstones

design - and outline the format of the course. From a relective practice perspective,
we give structured tangible advice how to run such a course in the form of guidelines

abstract = {Games are used in various learning situations and domains, among which is cultural
heritage. Storytelling is used in games regarding cultural places, but it often takes
a simple form. Thus, the authors’ aim is to investigate the possibility to communicate
cultural content through a narrative-based game that can function with multiple narratives.
Another core element of our design is the less exploited in serious games combination
of endogenous cooperation and competition. The social dimension of our design was
expressed through features of Classroom Multiplayer Presential Games (CMPGs), in respect
of using a one-to-many game environment projected on a single screen, while enhancing
collaborative work in small teams. After providing an overview of the game, we briefly
explain how this was implemented with the use of Twine, a free authoring tool for
the creation of interactive stories and text-based games. Subsequently, we present
the two interventions we conducted, one with teenage students (n = 19) and one with
post-graduate students (n = 14), to test how our game design functions with real users.
A mixed research methodology was followed in the two trials and data were collected
through observation, focus group discussions, short questionnaires, and game reports.
Findings indicated that the suggested design is playable but provided helpful insights
into its future improvements. The game managed to engage both teenagers and adults
with the cultural content and create motivation towards it. Learning gains were registered
for both groups, but these were more appreciated by the adult participants, who additionally
found the game to be more entertaining. The limited character of our results imposes
the need for future extensive evaluation of the game design in both formal and non-formal
educational contexts.},

were also observed between facial expression intensities and self reports from the

about how individual game elements support player adherence over time. This work draws
on evidence from existing frameworks and game design theories as well as from the
design of casual games to investigate how individual game mechanics affect player
attrition in a serious game. We implemented a math-learning game in which we could
individually layer various game mechanics, and over the course of 3 weeks, 99 participants
played one of six versions: Baseline, Rewards, Novelty, Completion, Waiting, or Blocking.
We compared the game versions by analyzing the players’ performance as well as behaviour.
Using survival analysis, we identified that the addition of Completion and Blocking
mechanics facilitated the strongest sustained engagement. These findings are congruent
with existing theories of player experience and promote the development of guidelines
on designing for sustained engagement in serious games.},

abstract = {Bounding the price of anarchy, which quantifies the damage to social welfare due to
selfish behavior of the participants, has been an important area of research in algorithmic
game theory. In this paper, we study this phenomenon in the context of a game modeling
queuing systems: routers compete for servers, where packets that do not get service
will be resent at future rounds, resulting in a system where the number of packets
at each round depends on the success of the routers in the previous rounds. We model
this as an (infinitely) repeated game, where the system holds a state (number of packets
held by each queue) that arises from the results of the previous rounds. We assume
that routers satisfy the no-regret condition, e.g. they use learning strategies to
identify the server where their packets get the best service.Classical work on repeated
games makes the strong assumption that the subsequent rounds of the repeated games
are independent (beyond the influence on learning from past history). The carryover
effect caused by packets remaining in this system makes learning in our context result
in a highly dependent random process. We analyze this random process and find that
if the capacity of the servers is high enough to allow a centralized and knowledgeable
scheduler to get all packets served even when service rates are halved, and queues
use no-regret learning algorithms, then the expected number of packets in the queues
will remain bounded throughout time, assuming older packets have priority. This paper
is the first to study the effect of selfish learning in a queuing system, where the
learners compete for resources, but rounds are not all independent: the number of
packets to be routed at each round depends on the success of the routers in the previous
rounds.},

episodes. The framework deals with five atomic aspects of coordinated activity: Players,
Locations, Actions, Time, and Objects. PLATO provides a vocabulary, methodology and

role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive

evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence

group of people with variety of motivations. Aggregating different insights and accelerating
the flow of information seems important for people in very different positions. At
the same time, the felt benefits for individuals seem to vary significantly based
on the career phase and the expert role. Overall, IGDA gatherings are importantly
connected to modes of learning in communities of practice, as they can initiate different
communal processes that then continue outside the immediate meetings.},

design. The MDA Framework, published in 2004, quickly became the most used guideline,
mostly in academic environments. It presents a definition for mechanic, but does not
elaborate on the steps to design one. This work intends to complement the MDA along
with other formal tools published since, to provide a game designer with a clear step-by-step
guide on how to design a video game from scratch. Within this study two new tools
are presented, the 5-Part Model for mechanic design, and the Risk/Reward Model for
difficulty balance.},

approach to single-player serious game design called "diegetic connectivity," where
task, mechanics, and story are tightly bound through conceptual relationships and
aesthetic presentation. To explore the challenges and opportunities of this approach,
we present a purpose-built second language acquisition (SLA) game called Arena, and
discuss results from a preliminary mixed-methods study directed at motivation, engagement,
and task outcomes. Finally, we discuss some of the critical aspects of diegetic connectivity,

process. In this work, we streamlined and systematized the playtesting process by
adding support for crowdsourced, on-demand playtesting directly into a game development
environment to test and evaluate platform games. Our system, called ARAPID (As Rapid
As Possible Iterative Design), manages playtesting from a control panel in Unity and
recruits players from Mechanical Turk. With this system, game designers can launch
playtests and visualize results directly in the editor. To better understand and evaluate
this approach, we ran three studies on two basic platform games. First, a game designer
used ARAPID to playtest and rapidly iterate on the design of the games; we found the
games were improved toward specific design goals. Second, we analyzed the impact of
different forms of recruitment on playtesting speed; we found that pre-recruitment
and over-recruitment of players can reduce the time needed to run playtests. Third,
we analyzed the impact of players' familiarity with the game on the precision of playtest
results; we found that whether or not players are allowed to replay the game can impact
results.},

proposed model aims to contribute to an informed game design process by focusing on
six perspectives of player participation: Playfulness, Challenge, Embodiment, Sociability,
Sensemaking and Sensoriality. These perspectives are then exercised along three operational
levels: Intention, Artifact and Participation - the setting of gameplay experience
goals, the characterization of the videogame object, and the evaluation of the player

Developing a game gives learners the possibility to experience an entire development

In this paper, we describe a first pilot of an interdisciplinary and international

nationalities and different learning expectations can work together to develop games.
We report on a first pilot with 24 students studying different subjects, such as computer

programs are highly engaging for students, can boost their employability, have a high
learning outcome, and raise their interest in international collaborations.},

to solve these shortcomings for novel designers by providing: 1) a development process

seen a rise in the creation of "frameworks" for use in industry and academic study

exists a "common sense" understanding of what a framework in game design might be,
there are limited attempts to formally add to their definition through discourse.
This paper seeks to address problems that may have led to this gap in our knowledge
about frameworks. We also outline a selection of frameworks that we believe to be
of use for developers, and present the questions that arose from early attempts to
define and compare these frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other
papers that attempt to address these basic concerns regarding frameworks in game design,
and only two other surveys of some of the various frameworks available. Through our
discussion and conclusion, we propose that further research should be done in the
interests of finding an appropriate measure for comparing frameworks, as well as suggest
potential methodologies to use. We stress the value of a process of discussion regarding
frameworks, over the output of a strict definition. It is our hope that readers will
find this paper a thought-provoking and useful resource for their own research and
practice.},

This study examines how player behaviour indicates constructs of curiosity-related

curiosity. We derive a curiosity measure from established self-report survey methodologies
relating to social capital, behavioural activation, obsessive/harmonious passion,
and BrainHex player types. We present the results of a cross-sectional study with
data from 1,745 players of Destiny--a popular shared-world first-person shooter (FPS)
game. Behaviour metrics were paired with four curiosity factors: 'social' curiosity, 'sensory/cognitive' curiosity, 'novelty-seeking' curiosity, and 'explorative' curiosity.
Our findings provide key insights into the relationships between players curiosity
and their in-game behaviour. We infer curiosity-related motivational profiles from
behaviour metrics, and discuss how this may impact game design and player-computer
interaction.},

are embedded into the modulation information of PVRTC (PowerVR Texture Compression)

texture format, the decompressed image quality will be reduced after secret messages
are embedded. So the optimization mechanism is applied to improve the image quality.

the benefits of code quality, helping students learn to read source code written by
others, and reinforcing concepts of object-orientation, particularly the multiple

benefits also brings challenges: faculty must invest time in learning the library,

scenarios often require a critical mass of users, applying gamification to different
areas in order to increase user engagement has been proposed. However, existing attempts
often default to the standard points, badges, and leaderboards and fail to recognize
the potential of exploiting game design elements beyond creating user engagement.
We propose not to think of Gamified Participatory Sensing when designing such systems,
but rather of Sensified Gaming. To this end, this work presents a collection of design
patterns and game mechanics that can be used to identify or design suitable games,
into which participatory sensing tasks can be embedded. We identified four core tasks

abstract = {Both engagement and motivation are important factors in any learning process. Fortunately,
there are different approaches worth considering during the design process of learning
experiences that could help educators create engagement. One that has shown great
potential is the inclusion of game design principles, or game-like experiences, in
a curriculum. This paper presents the design and analysis of an e-learning activity
within a software engineering course that relies on the application of such an approach
as its motivational foundation from a purely educational standpoint (i.e. not as entertainment).
The goal was to encourage adult learners to solve non-graded formative activities
and to increase their sense of kinship to the class group. After one semester, the
results revealed a positive assessment of the experience designed and student engagement.},

the increasingly challenged news media industry could benefit from the knowledge that
has sustained the success of the game industry. Our findings indicate that the formal
practice of game design offers three key foci that may likely prove useful to industries
and practices concerned with improving their audience engagement strategies. These
three foci are experience, agency and play. We suggest that these three elements are
the key to engagement in non-game contexts and are a likely path to improving the
struggles facing not only the news industry, but other domains like activism, social
impact, and civic participation.},

game could be used to educate employees about Information Security. A game was developed
with the aim of educating employees in this field of study. If people were motivated
to play the game, without external motivation from an organisation, then these people
would also be motivated to learn about information security. Therefore, a secondary
aim of this game was to be self-motivating. An experiment was conducted in order to
test whether or not these aims were met.The experiment was conducted on a play test
group and a control group. The play test group played the game before completing a
questionnaire, while the control group, simply, completed the questionnaire. This
paper discusses the research design of the experiment and also provides an initial
analysis of the results. The game design will be discussed which also provides guidelines
for future game designers to follow.},

abstract = {The increase in fidelity found in the latest generation of video game platforms has
garnered interest from many different arenas. Up to now, the primary objective of
these games has been to simulate the real world within the gaming environment. Thus
it was only natural that some would begin using video games in place of specially
developed simulators as a means of providing training. Some argue that the advancement
of training programs based on video game platforms has not advanced as much as hoped
for. The prospect of utilizing video game platforms as the basis for training systems
remains a tempting one, though, in light of today's financial climate.To attain these
goals, advanced game development tools should enhance already existing functionality
within existing game engines, aiming for high quality sound and visual effects, realistic
dynamics, appropriate responses and well maintained timing. In this effort we propose
modifications to already existing game functionalities of a training module to bring
about effective and dynamic simulations involving the use of unused functionalities
of the existing game engine. We emphasize how the promoted changes mold the existing
training module effectively to create highly realistic and interactive training environments

research questions in fields such as psychology and human-computer interaction. There
is an increased use of games as scientific tools to assess and train the cognitive,
as well as non-cognitive traits and abilities of players. However, games designed
as research tools have a unique and challenging set of considerations so that they
meet both the requirements of a scientific protocol, while also maintaining an acceptable
gaming experience. Additionally, the success of a research game requires extensive
planning and co-creation support for trans-disciplinary teams. This paper describes
five critical considerations for the design and implementation of custom-built games
as scientifically valid and reliable experimental test beds. These findings resulted
from several years of work creating game artifacts to study cognitive training and
assessment of individual differences. This class of games presents unique design challenges
that are often at odds with traditional game design conventions. However, there are
many promising applications and use cases for thoughtfully instrumented games that
are capable of generating data with comparable accuracy to traditional and previously
validated measures.},

physical activity, a process called "gamification." Gamification is believed to motivate
users to become more active, and is commonly implemented in commercial products. However,
relatively few studies rigorously evaluated the effectiveness of gamification, and
they yielded contradicting findings. We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual
rewards and social comparison--two game elements prevalent in persuasive systems.
We developed a research prototype, called "StepByStep," aimed to promote routine walking.
We created different versions of StepByStep, implemented as an application on Android-based
mobile devices, and compared their effectiveness in two field studies. Study 1 showed
that a quantified version of the application--offering continuous measurement of walking
time, a daily goal, and real-time feedback on progress toward this goal--facilitated
reflection on activity and significantly increased walking time over baseline level.
Study 2 showed that gamified versions offering virtual rewards and social comparison
were only as effective as the quantified version. Thus, we advise designers to facilitate
reflection on meaningful aspects of physical activity by developing novel ubiquitous
measures. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of systematic comparisons
between quantified and gamified elements for better understanding their motivational
affordances.},

Life review provides older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences,

We held workshops in which 33 senior participants (ages 51-85) co-played a commercial
game, titled "Long Journey of Life," paired with young adult partners (ages 19-23).
The young partners asked senior participants about their associated memories during
the life review activity. Through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication
themes during the life review activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation,
life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclosure, interpretation
of metaphors, and explanation of game control methods. We investigated the relationships
between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. In
addition, we identified how participants' responses to the game differ depending on
the player's characteristics and generation. Game design suggestions for an effective
intergenerational life review using digital games were offered.},

abstract = {The low performance and drop-outs in Computer Science classes are frequently attributed
to lack of engagement and motivation. Meanwhile, gamification - the application of
game design principles and game mechanics to a non-game context -- increasingly attracts
the interest of educators due to its potential to foster motivation and behavioral
changes in learning contexts. Course gamification is about using game elements, such
as instant feedback, freedom to fail, freedom of choice, achievements, leveling, progress
mechanics, badges, and leaderboards, as interventions in the learning process. This
BOF will provide a platform for a discussion of when and how course gamification strategies
can be beneficial for improving student motivation, engagement and achievements in
Computer Science classes. Questions to be discussed include: What game elements could
be useful in gamifying a computer science course? How can an instructor incorporate
game elements in the design of their courses? What support the instructor may need
for gamifying their courses? Could some game elements have potential drawbacks on
student motivation and performance? The discussion leaders and attendees with experience
in applying gamification in their courses will share examples of successes or failures,
challenges, problems, tips, and techniques for gamifying learning with each other
and those new to the use of gamification. Two NSF sponsored projects related to the
use of gamification in STEM courses will seed the discussion. As an outcome of the
discussion, we hope to collectively identify some lessons learned and challenges to
be overcome for a successful application of gamification in Computer Science education.},

evaluating the strength standards of lineups in auto battler games, and build a system
for implementing such measurement. A neural network model is firstly trained for quick
strength evaluation of the lineup. The genetic algorithm is then adopted and modified
for the purpose of lineup mining of auto battler. Finally, strong lineups can be obtained
under certain constraints. In this way, game developers can complete a balanced analysis
before the game goes online. Moreover, the proposed approach can be generalized to
balance analysis tasks of other games.},

with independent experts to support an educational programme with a diverse range
of skills. The curriculum discussed in this article, connects with a wide variety
of subjects (while strengthening and supporting one another), such as, programming,
mathematics, computer graphics, physics-based animation, parallel systems, and artificial

abstract = {Recruitment of students to Computer Science has been a major focus of effort for educators
since the dot-com bust in 2001. Two largely disparate themes in these efforts are
women and games. There have been numerous efforts to broaden participation in computer
science by attracting women to the field. At the same time, games are increasingly
used to attract new students. Our interest lies at the intersection of these methods.
We began using game design/development projects in our software engineering course,
CS121, in 2002. The game focus was extremely successful with many of our students.
But a nagging minority of students objected to building games, and women tend to be
overrepresented in that group.So while are awed by the power of games to engage and
motivate many of our students, we need to ask: Do games in our curriculum reinforce
gender stereotypes of Computer Science? Do they foster development of the so-called
"Geek mythology?"[7] In short, must we choose: women or games?We argue the answer
is no. While traditional game projects may disenfranchise women, our experience shows
that serious game projects both attract and engage them. This paper describes our
results.},

by researchers in psychoacoustics only, to measure psychoacoustic thresholds in preschoolers.
Next it presents another game (DIESEL-X), designed by dyslexia researchers and game
designers, to remediate the shortcomings of the former game. Via a repeated measures
experiment (n = 95), the game experience, attention, and psychoacoustic thresholds
are compared. It is shown that the children prefer the game experience of DIESEL-X
over APEX. Moreover, the former game was able to measure lower frequency-modulation
thresholds than APEX. These results demonstrate that when it comes down to game-based
assessment of children's perceptual capabilities, the quality of game design not only
has an effect on game experience, but equally on the scientific measurements obtained
via such a game-based assessment.},

the next two decades, there is still much to be done in defining what game design
and development programs represent and what those in the field respect and value in
the process of tenure and promotion. Despite trends that indicate the field is beginning
to stabilize, it seems there are more questions than answers as to what academics
should be doing in these programs to achieve tenure and to have a career such in which
they can achieve the awards and accolades of the academic system. In this paper, the

programs and pose questions as to what barriers are still prevalent for careers in

unclear. Seeking to estimate this value in two popular Flash games, we conducted a
series of large-scale A/B tests in which we selectively removed aesthetic improvements
and examined the effect of each component on play time, progress, and return rate.
We found that music and sound effects had little or no effect on player retention
in either game, while animations caused users to play more. We also found, counterintuitively,
that optional rewards caused players to play less in both games. In one game, this
gameplay modification affected play time three times as much as the largest aesthetic
variation. Our methodology provides a way to determine where resources may be best
spent during the game design and development process.},

First, we verify that our constructive approach can be applied to this gameplay. Then,
we test the accuracy of our method. Finally, we compare subjective assessments of
the game's difficulty, both from the designers and the players, to the values predicted
by our model. Results show that a very simple version of our model can predict the
probability to the player has to lose with enough accuracy to be useful as a game
design tool. However, the study points out that the subjective feeling of difficulty
seems to be complex, and not only based on a short term estimate of the chances of
success.},

called game design pedagogic plan (GDPP) to facilitate learning in games. This paper
discusses the development process of our proposed framework. Comparisons with existing
frameworks are included. Evaluation and practical performance results are also demonstrated.},

applications for purposes other than pure entertainment. Prominent examples often
aim to motivate a specific target behavior or follow learning goals.Nonetheless, the
current practice of gamification often seems onesided regarding its motivational design
as reward structures dominate most examples. One reason might be the lack of an established,
holistic perspective on the user that informs the designer on personal, motivational
and game-related attributes and needs within the context.This paper introduces the
concept of a play-persona, that builds on multifaceted theories of personality psychology,
motivational psychology, game-design and user-centered design and a series of expert
interviews across this disciplines. Furthermore, an explorative study regarding correlations
between personality and play preferences was conducted. The resulting design-tool
is suggested to encourage strong and elaborated discussions on user's needs among
the design team, thus supporting the design process.},

is included either by having health topics as educational content, making players

evaluation is widely used as a low-cost expert evaluation method in software and game
development for assessing usability problems. The goal of our research was to assess
how modular playability heuristics work in the evaluation of different types of health
games. Based on a literature review we collected a six-module set of playability heuristics.
Three different games with direct or indirect health enhancing effects were evaluated
with the derived set of heuristics. The results suggest that playability heuristics
are useful in evaluating various types of health-enhancing games, provided that the
heuristic modules chosen for the evaluation are suitable for the game in question.
Two new heuristic modules are suggested to be designed for better evaluation of typical
characteristics of health games.},

students to the field of Computer Science. However, as students are growing up in
contact with several interactive computational devices, one could suspect that they
already possess an empirical, informal knowledge about the quality of some types of
human-computer interfaces. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed a Game Design
Workshop to be offered to high school students. Based on the results of its first
offering, we identified that issues related to displaying the game status and score,
response time of controls and graphical and sound features were quite relevant to
students. Students added additional features to solve those issues in a spontaneous
way. An analysis of the developed games indicates that students had to learn and apply
new concepts related to programming in order to implement the additional features.},

can enable them to make valuable contributions when involved in the design of games.
Within this paper we discuss our approach to the involvement of children in the game
design process, specifically to inform a game narrative. We describe two design workshops
with children, which focused on the design of the narrative within a literacy game
based on the Day of the Dead festival. We describe how the knowledge that resulted
from these workshops furthered our understanding of children's storytelling schema
and preferences for games as well as their approach to story creation and expression
during the game design process. We also discuss how our findings informed an initial
set of design principles for guiding narrative design within children's games as well
as recommendations for including storytelling design activities within the technology
design process.},

have taken up the challenge of establishing how to best design them. However, the
current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks.
Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are
invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often
overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives
that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects: project
organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain
these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of
an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary
consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of
underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives,
to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open
the conversation about them.},

phenomenon that can be considered as a type of slow, tangible output responding to
an environmental stimulus or an input. Given the relative slowness of growth, once
it becomes part of game mechanics, the feature can lead to slow interactivity and
slow gameplay in biotic games – a relatively new type of bio-digital game that enables
playful human-microbe interactions. Currently, there is a lack of annotations on existing
biotic game design guidelines, that 1) recognise biological slowness as a potentially
beneficial feature in game design, and 2) provide specific advice on how organism's
slow response time can be effectively incorporated in biotic games. To start addressing
these limitations, we report on an initial set of design lessons learnt from our research
on slow biotic games. Through these lessons, we have formulated and outlined a set
of practical recommendations for prospective designers of slow biotic games.},

the audio games design process. As audio games are computer games that rely on sound
only, they demand or invite the players to 'build the game world in their mind'. Hence,
compared to video games, missing visual information is filled in and created by mental
imaginary. This makes the genre exciting and simultaneously open to both players with
or without visual impairments. In terms of game design, audio games, however, bring
additional challenges to the process. How does a designer sketch games that he or
she cannot see? To explore such issues, we created an open-sourced online audio game
editor that can function as a sketchbook for audio games. By studying how people use
the editor to create audio games, we hope to better understand audio game design and
foster the growth of this interesting game genre.},

abstract = {Successful services or products have in common being well suited to users' needs and
expectations, having high usability, and generating positive feelings towards its
usage. The probability of success is maximized when such concerns are taken into consideration
from the very beginning and users take center stage in the development process, and
continue throughout the development and testing stages. Centering in the users also
increases inclusion. Furthermore, design is an interdisciplinary activity conducted
by people with distinct backgrounds. It is a challenging task to build cohesive design
teams working seamlessly towards a common goal. For these reasons is important to
develop consistent methodologies that are able to put users at the center of development,
and use information on their emotional states and personality.Such methodologies are
being used successfully in the computer game industry, where the process of user-centered
development is a natural concept to achieve success.This work proposes a gamified
methodology named Services &amp; Products Gamified Design (SPGD) that can be used to design
any user centered service or product.The proposal is based on a card game that offers
a low cost solution to easily manipulate information and allows a complete understanding
of the target objectives regardless of the designers' background. SPGD provides an
innovative way to create a highly communicative environment based on game design by
treating users holistically, including their needs, emotions and personality, and
putting them at center of the design process.Treating the users holistically and putting
them at the center of the project, the SGPD has strong potential for application in
services and products for persons with special needs and/or disabilities.},

abstract = { Game balancing is one of the most challenging features to be implemented in a typical
game design process. Approaches for evaluating and achieving game balancing include
extensive playtesting - which typically requires several iterations of games with
subtle adjustments in the components and adopted strategies that resemble brute force
- and algorithmic solutions that use qualitative and measurable design goals when
developing game components. The literature contains examples of methods that employ
artificial intelligence to generate maps in computer games that offer balanced and
fairness of starting conditions for the players. The use of such methods for tabletop
games, however, has been scarce in the academic literature, for the best of the authors’
knowledge. This paper investigates the application of the ant colony optimisation
metaheuristic to generate content and improving game balance for two well-known tabletop
games, namely, Terra Mystica and Settlers of Catan. The resultant configurations satisfy
complex game-dependent requirements while optimising a model for game balancing. Moreover,
the results showed to be promising when compared with existing game maps and setup.},

abstract = {Disease of the lower limb musculoskeletal system is one of the most common diseases
in elders. The use of interactive somatosensory games (ISGs) in rehabilitation has
been widely used. Most relevant studies have focused on efficacy, while only a few
have investigated the difficulties, willingness, and requirements of elderly people
in playing the game. Therefore, this study is to design an ISG that is focused on
lower-limb rehabilitation and to explore whether the designed ISG can enhance the
willingness and motivation of elders to undergo rehabilitation. In this study, 15
elders (5 males and 10 females with average age of 78 years) with degenerative joint
disease were recruited to participate in our pretest-posttest design experiments.
First, the subjects completed a five-minute pre-test questionnaire after a one-minute
traditional rehabilitation (TR). Second, they completed a five-minute post-test questionnaire
after a one-minute interactive somatosensory game rehabilitation (ISGR). The average
experiment time for each subject was 25 min. We used a t-test to analyze the data.
According to the result, there are significant differences in four factors (i.e.,
interest (t=-6.89, p&lt;0.05), self-affirmation (t=-3.17, p&lt;0.05), understanding of rehabilitation
states (t=-3.31, p&lt;0.05), and fatigue (t=2.49, p&lt;0.05)). The results show that (1)
for the same treatment arrangement, ISGR can make the elderly people more interested
in and reduce their fatigue while undertaking the long-term rehabilitation; (2) using
ISGR can increase their understanding of, and their confidence in, their rehabilitation
states; and (3) elders generally have positive attitudes toward the ISGR. The results
and analysis of willingness and needs in this study can be as a reference for future
studies of rehabilitation game development, and the development of rehabilitation
to improve the health of the elders.},

requirements, owing to the high cost of physically auditing everchanging roads and

studies have relied on volunteers with free time and high motivation. In this paper,
we propose a crowdsourcing platform for constructing accessibility maps to support
four participation modes: Reporter for people having plenty of free time and high
motivation; Gaming reporter for people having plenty of free time but with low motivation;
Walker for people lacking enough free time but with high motivation; and Gaming walker
for people lacking enough free time and with low motivation. This design allows people
to select a suitable participation method, depending on their time and motivation.
In this study, we developed a prototype by integrating deep learning techniques, a
game design theory, and heatmap visualization.},

points for group brainstorming of game mechanics and themes. It is important to discuss
these types of approaches in the games community. Game design as a practice is still

abstract = {Playable cities and smart cities share the same infrastructure yet present different
approaches to citizen participation. In this paper, the playable cities approach to
digital infrastructure is contrasted with various iterations of the smart city to
explore affordances for game design in the hybrid city. Placemaking is introduced
in relation to play via a short history of playful urban interventions over the last
century leading to an approach that uses strategies from a range of disciplines to
explore game design that acknowledges cities as always being in the process of becoming
and how games may allow citizens to shape the future, preserve the past, and recognise
the present within the urban environments in which they live.Three examples are explored
to demonstrate early work towards this approach: a resource management game based
on real census data, an urban design app that uses augmented reality to situate citizens
in the process, and location-based augmented reality game that explores the role of
placemaking at macro and micro scales. These examples draw out and demonstrate the
opportunities afforded by a playable cities approach that interacts with digital infrastructure,
making it tangible and enabling social structures to emerge through play communities.Placemaker
is explored in detail in relation to the site and city in which it is situated and
how it relates to architecture, community, infrastructure and place. This game is
built upon urban codemaking, an established framework for decoding urban environments
and appropriating them for play. Three different stages of the year-long game are
articulated in relation to the different scales of public space and perception that
they have impact upon. The interaction techniques and design processes of the game
are analysed in relation to digital infrastructure at the scale of the hybrid city.Finally,
the examples lead to speculation on their potential use as to situate dialogue between
citizens and digital infrastructure, particularly in relation to participatory urban
planning. The games actively use and engage with urban planning and design concepts
and language, inviting players to re-imagine their neighbourhood in these terms. As
such, they demonstrate the potential for the future development of urban planning
games involving citizens in participatory design processes.},

of their physical and mental development. Technological advances have been manifesting
new and exciting avenues of interaction when children play games, ranging from board
and card games, to videogames that are played on mobile devices, virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR) headsets, robotic systems, and social agents. These games encompass
a wide range of applications aiming to provide educational benefits, promote development,
enhance well-being, or simply enjoy leisure time. Along with the fun and excitement,
these advancements also bring unique challenges in the game design process due to
the inclusion of complex technology, the maximization of the players’ engagement and
expectations and interests of the children. The player-centric approach of co-designing
games with the target audience has a unique position as it involves creating the games
for and with the children, allowing them to act as an equal stakeholder rather than
simple users or informants. This half-day workshop aims to expose the researchers
to collaborative techniques used in game design to create interactive and playful
activities for children that involve contemporary technologies such as AR/VR and social

abstract = {Gaming has weaved itself in the fabrics of everyday life: in the living room, in the
therapist's practice, in the class room or in a senior residency. Motives for gaming
have gone beyond the epicurist's pleasure principle. Recently, players embrace more
serious purposes as well, reflected in games for therapy or games for learning. The
massive adoption of entertainment technologies by a wider audience is the characteristic
of the past decade.This wide uptake of entertainment media into society would not
have been possible if there was not a growing diversity of enabling technologies and
a growing understanding of how to design for and enable certain psycho-social consequences.
These societal and technological evolutions are naturally reflected in this year's
Fun and Games conference.It is our great pleasure to present you the proceedings of
the 3rd International conference on Fun and Games 2010. Fun and Games is a leading
forum for academics and practitioners who are interested in, work with, design for
or conduct research on all aspects of gaming and entertainment technologies, exploring
the boundaries of gaming technologies and gaming experiences.Fun and Games 2010 is
the third edition of the Fun and Games conference series, designed as a biannual,
single-track conference that features state-of-the-art academic as well as design
research on the broad spectrum of gaming aspects and entertainment computing, for
a wide range of player types. The Fun and Games conference series started in 2006
in Preston, UK as a playful event where academics and practitioners can interact together.
In 2008, the conference was held in Eindhoven, the Netherlands where it married the
best of academic writing with the most innovative user experiences.This year's conference
is held in the lively university town of Leuven, Belgium on 15, 16 and 17 September
2010. Fun and Games 2010 is organized by the Centre for User Experience Research,
K.U.Leuven and the e-Media Lab, GROUP T - Leuven Engineering College, both part of
the K.U.Leuven Association and with the participation of the HCI &amp; Usability Unit
of the ICT&amp;S Center, University of Salzburg and the Game Experience Lab, Eindhoven
University of Technology.Fun and Games 2010 continues to provide an avenue for presenting
peer reviewed academic and practitioner papers, for discussing posters, for showing
live demonstrations, for organizing workshops and hosting tutorials. Furthermore,
this third Fun and Games conference invited student designers and student developers
to submit their work to the first Fun and Games Design Competition. The nominees will
showcase their work during the conference and the winners of the design competition
will be awarded at the conference.To this year's edition of Fun and Games, 55 short
and full papers were submitted, next to the numerous submissions in the other categories.
All paper submissions were subjected to a blind peer review process of at least three
reviewers.In total, 19 high-quality papers are accepted for publication. More particularly,
16 long papers and 3 short papers are selected, yielding an acceptance rate of 34%.
Accepted papers are published in the ACM Digital Library. Furthermore, all papers
are invited to submit their extended work to a special issue in the Journal of Arts
and Technology (IJART), the leading journal in its area. Additionally, the most promising
paper will be awarded at the conference.The variety of submissions to Fun and Games
2010 resulted in a rich and diverse conference program. The following topics are covered:
serious gaming, self-adaptive systems, music and audio systems, pervasive technologies,
tangible interfaces, usability and user experience evaluation, motivation, experiential
and identification theories, and game production. Special player audiences are researched,
such as children, seniors or therapists. The academic research papers are clustered
around 5 tracks: Game design and evaluation; Systems, software and enabling technologies;
Special target groups; Game(r) theory; and Methods and game design studies.Besides
the 19 papers, the conference hosts one tutorial, three workshops, poster sessions
and demonstrations and finally the Fun and Games Design Competition.},

abstract = {The game industry is one of the faster growing sectors in the United States and the
profession of game programmer is in high demand. The first step for one trying to
breaking into the field of game programmer is to obtain the proper education and skillsets
required by the game industry. However, there is a disparity between the skillsets
that the game industry demands of game programmers versus what educational institutions
provide. Educational institutions offering game development education must be in alignment
with the skillset demands of the game industry. This includes educating students on
the various game development roles and disciplines along with the proper knowledge
and skillsets, which will aid students to determine the right career path and then
aid in developing the right set of skills. Several issues currently exist that have
led to the disparity between game programming education and the game programming profession,
such as the lack of academia and industry collaboration, the lack of standards and
accreditation, and the desire for academic institutions to attract students. One step
toward to reaching this goal is with the educational institutions themselves. Educational
institutions must provide a career-oriented education that is proactive and responsive
to industry needs. This paper investigates (a) how game programming education differs
from other game-related disciplines, (b) whether or not the currently available game
education is serving the purpose to produce immediately employable game programmers,
and (c) specifically which types of curriculum are appropriate for students seeking
careers as game programmers.},

application of Animal Computer Interaction (ACI) to game design. The game is intended
for play by a human and a domesticated cat. The design of the game pays close attention
to inter-species gameplay and the need to capture the attention of the cat while maintaining
its appeal to the human. The game consists of an interactive floor projection with
two distinct input methods, a Wiimote game controller for use by the human player
and a Kinect sensor to track the movement of the cat. Initial tests have shown the
game to engage humans and cats in gameplay and highlight the way for further developments
in inter-species gameplay.},

competitive advantage, improving them by means of innovation and redesign activities.
Some approaches, like Social BPM, argue that own clients can contribute with the business
process innovations, but these clients have also own interests and motivations, making
that collaboration a challenge. It is argued that before contributing with a process,
people should understand it. One way to give the processes particularities is using
digital games. In that sense, the research proposal is to study the interactions of
processes through digital games, and such is necessary to think how design digital
games, aiming to make easier the process representation in games. Therefore, this
paper presents a mapping method between processes models elements and digital game
design elements, focusing in facilitate the processes representations in games. From
this method, have been made case studies in order to check the mapping similarities
performed with the same process, and the mapping replicability to different processes.
As result, we have observed that the mapping method seems useful to get digital game
design elements based on business processes models, helping the representation of
them as digital games.},

into the MR derivation process in a puzzle-solving way. The game design carefully
considers how to guide users to participate actively, how to present conjectured MRs
intuitively, and how to validate MRs effectively. So far, we have built and deployed
a preliminary version of the game, and received active feedbacks, suggesting both
promising results and useful advices for future improvement.},

abstract = {Project-based courses in Art + Design and Computer Science curriculum foster innovation
spaces that require creative thinking and multidisciplinary problem solving for unorthodox
scenarios through the interplay of technology, arts, and design thinking. “Story-Go-Round”
is a physical development platform for producing augmented digital experiences, designed
exclusively as an assignment to tell stories through interactive control and gameplay
via circular rotating sets. We propose a miniature mechanical and replaceable “carousel-like”
stage linked to a game engine, which controls the rotation using a motor as well as
streaming live camera feeds of the stage directly into the game environment.The assignment
is inspired by the historical aspects of replaceable computer media such as game cartridges,
and early animation devices such as the zoetrope and animated concertina.&nbsp; The stage
component is open to continuous physical interaction for an evolving set design, like
the process used in stop motion animation set building. The assignment asks students
to develop a seamless circling narrative by understanding material and spatial choices
and their impact as seen through the camera as well as inside the game engine as logically
meaningful and visually important components. The narrative can evolve around a defined
theme, or simply focus on engaging and innovative play.In groups, students complete
the stage design by curating resources and assembling found objects, fabricating custom
environments, through hand-skills, digital fabrication and simple electronics. They
then proceed to produce digital assets, animation and interactivity, including and
not limited to game mechanics, control schemes and augmented reality. The assignment
lowers the intimidation factor by reenacting the forgiving process of making dioramas
and integrating this with foundational skills in game design and programming, and
the breadth of digital making. The benefit of this assignment is to think outside
the box and leave the comfort zone in order to innovate, collaborate, and learn.},

may actually undermine users' intrinsic motivation. This online experiment examined
the effects of three commonly employed game design elements -- points, leaderboard,
levels -- on users' performance, intrinsic motivation, perceived autonomy and competence

performance, but did not affect perceived autonomy, competence or intrinsic motivation.
Our findings suggest that points, levels and leaderboards by themselves neither make
nor break users' intrinsic motivation in non-game contexts. Instead, it is assumed
that they act as progress indicators, guiding and enhancing user performance. While
more research on the contextual factors that may potentially mediate the effects of
game elements on intrinsic motivation is required, it seems that the implementation
of points, levels, and leaderboards is a viable means to promote specific user behavior

naturally encourage problem solving and incremental learning of their game play systems,

game play, then expands player affordances to include the use of automation and abstraction.
Programming in-game entities is presented to players as a constrained selection and
refinement process, which they explore and master in order to achieve in-game goals.
We are exploring whether computational problem solving can be cast as accessible,
intrinsically engaging game play, by following principles of good game design: exploratory
player-controlled pace and direction, encouraging trial and low-cost failure, immediate
formative feedback, level-appropriate challenge, non-intrusive assessment and expanding
affordances. The game we are building to evaluate these factors will be positioned
as a bridge for middle- and early high-school students to engage with computational
problem solving.},

abstract = {Students seeking to learn musical skills face a highly complex task with a significant
cognitive load. Serious games are one method that has been proposed to help manage
this complexity. They offer to present content in a fun, attractive, familiar package
to increase student’s engagement and help them foster self-regulated and independent
learning behaviours. In this paper, we examine the ways in which serious mobile games
for music facilitate and encourage learning in their players. We call this the learning
management model of a game, and it comprises three sub-models: a feedback model, an
incentive and achievement model, and a progression model. By defining the models used
by existing games, we can understand both how developers are approaching the task
of serious game design, how effective their designs might be, and where improvements
could be made in the future. We found that many of the choices made by developers
indicate a tendency towards implementing functionality that minimises and simplifies
the complexity of development. Players are rarely given feedback beyond whether they
are correct or incorrect, they are rarely encouraged to or given the means by which
to reflect on their performance over time, and they are relied upon to set their own
path through content they are, by definition, unfamiliar with. Although the games
already offer some educational value and provide benefits over traditional teaching
materials, there remains significant scope for improvement in their learning management.},

The expansion of quantity has not seen an associated expansion of quality. Studies
of the usability of tablet games for children typically take place in laboratory settings
and fail to understand the context of use. This paper describes a study of 'at home'
use of tablet games with children and their families that sought to examine how such
games were played and how parents managed such game play. The children who participated
in the study had cognitive, sensory or physical needs and these multiple needs brought
many difficulties to the surface for parents mediating tablet use. A thematic analysis
using four codes was applied to bring findings from diaries and interviews. Challenges
for general tablet game design have emerged around designing for family routines,
designing for working together, and designing to scaffold children's understanding.},

the years the participants have networked and learned from each other. In addition
to this, at least three prototypes have been taken into further development. In this
paper we evaluate how the format of QGJ performed. We discuss both the organizing
of the events as well as the utility of the game prototypes. In addition to our observations

threat. Each spatial audio system, however, had different effects on the perception
of threat, stealth, realism and position estimation, on all three different visual
scenes. Meanwhile, the absence of spatial audio can confuse people and contribute
towards inaccurate enemy localisation. With this in mind, a tailored approach to the
game design requirements for each project is recommended. Rather than a single, spatialised

abstract = {Game development is a complex and labor-intensive endeavor. Game environments, storylines,
audio, and character behaviors are carefully crafted requiring graphics artists, storytellers,
and software developers to work in unison. Often games end up with a delicate mix
of hard-wired behavior in the form of traditional code and somewhat more responsive
behavior in the form of large collections of complex rules. Similarly, audio, video,
and graphics are carefully and manually curated and synchronized with game actions.
The addition of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have only added to
the many challenges that game developers and storytellers face.As a technology provider,
it has always been our primary goal to democratize game development and digital storytelling.
One way to do so is to to bring the latest technologies to our developers to help
them overcome some of the above-mentioned challenges. Over the past few years, data
intensive Machine Learning (ML) solutions have obliterated rule-based and manually
curated systems in the enterprise - think Amazon, Netflix, and Uber. Obviously, our
developers operate in a very different field from these enterprises, yet we have found
great promise in the data-driven ML approach to game development.ML and more specifically
Deep Learning (DL) allow content creators to shift to data-driven approaches. DL has
recently gained significant traction in the research community in the areas of Computer
Vision and Speech Recognition. Success in these areas have spurred the pursuit of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) for gameplay and character development. Deep
RL allows us to train Non-player Characters (NPC) rather than program them. NPC behavior
can be learned either through human gameplay (Imitation Learning) or in automated
game simulations. Either way, as the complex and strategic behavior of an NPC can
be learned, it potentially disrupts the way games are developed and perhaps even experienced
by the consumer. Deep RL is not limited to game strategy and path finding as researchers
also have demonstrated promising results in the area of character animation. Another
new area of interest for content creators is Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs). GANs
are DL-based models that have learned to generate output that is representative of
the input samples used to train them. In other words, these models can be used to
generate very naturally looking textures such as grass or rocks. GANs can also be
used to upscale low-resolution images by "filling in" the missing details. At Unity
Technologies, we have explored the use of DL and GANs in content creation and Deep
RL in character development. I will share our learnings and the Unity APIs we use
with the audience and hopefully inspire content developers and researchers alike to
start exploring these new technologies to create digital experiences that are out
of this world.},

player's environment provide kinematic constraints (on collision) and serve as obstructions
both visually (occlusion) and during gameplay. Using single camera depth information,
players can use familiar vector drawing tools to rapidly create and modify lines,
rings, paths, and turns of domino tiles. We thereby provide a method for placing a
plurality of gaming objects by converting raycasted anchor points into paths of game
objects. This opens up novel possibilities of authoring tools specially adapted for
AR game development or game-integrated level editing.},

that user testing with low fidelity prototypes, which is recommended in mainstream

is not appropriate when designing these kind of games. Designers should instead, as
early as possible in the design process, experiment with technology and expose working
prototypes to play test with children. A case study, in which we designed several
games and tested in three iterations, is also presented. The games were designed for
and tested with RaPIDO, a specially designed platform for prototyping mobile and interactive
technology. Finally, we argue that our hypothesis regarding technology-rich prototyping
is confirmed, since the feedback from the children concerned the realized interaction,
and aspects of play and social interaction were experienced in real context, instead
of an imagined way as a mock-up would have allowed.},

the usability experts become recognized part of the development community through
adapting their ways of work into the culture of the OSS project and submitting code

abstract = {"The Heretic", the latest real-time short film by Unity's Demo Team features two entirely
vfx-based characters, Boston and Morgan. VFX-based characters are notoriously hard
to conceptualize, especially in motion. Building and using real-time tools allowed
us to explore the space of possibilities and quickly arrive at designs we were satisfied
with. The character of Boston is made up of steel wires navigating the environment,
conforming to the shape of a bird-like creature. Animating thousands of wires in a
traditional way was unthinkable. The challenge then lied in building tools allowing
to express the intention of the artists, allow for emergent behavior, but also make
it directable at the same time. Boston is implemented as a set of tools, scripts,
and shaders within the Unity engine. The character Morgan doesn't have a clearly-
defined physical manifestation, morphs between its female and male forms, and constantly
varies its size. Morgan is implemented using the Unity Visual Effect Graph, extended
with additional tools and features. The presentation will be of value to all creative
communities that base their process on real-time technology - both within game development
and real-time filmmaking. From a film production perspective, such characters are
typically entirely within the domain of expertise of post-production / VFX studios.
With the introduction of realtime-based VFX characters, these characters can be included
much earlier in the production process and are more open for experimentation and better
connected to the rest of the production elements. From a game development perspective,
real- time VFX-based characters allow for bolder and more unconventional creative
ideas to be conceived and executed and thereby contribute to richer and more elaborate
virtual worlds. They allow the creatives to express more complex, abstract or surreal
ideas and develop interesting and original aesthetics.},

were measured before, within and after the insertion of gamification. Results: We
observed a beneficial gamification influence on timesheet fill. Based on historical
data and on our measurements, the performance was four times better with gamification
when compared with the conventional (i.e. without gamification) approach. Even after
gamification removal, the performance remained statistically better than historical
records. Conclusion: Gamification improved the attendance on timesheet fulfills and
this could help the project manager make the software development more manageable

However, there is a demand for methods that can provide a solution for pathfinding
tasks in 3D working space. These tasks mostly come from area of robotics and game
development, where it is often required to get a solution in real-time.The main problem,
besides the lack of appropriate methods, is that in 3D environment the working space
size increases greatly in comparison with 2D case, and it becomes harder to construct
a precise representation of this space while maintaining low size of search graph.
To overcome this, methods that lower graph size, whether explicitly or implicitly,
are used.This paper provides a brief review on some of existing approaches, comparison
of their effectiveness and presentation a new method of real-time pathfinding in 3D
environment that can be helpful in real-time calculations (i.e. game development area).
This brief review will be referred to when comparing proposed method with existing
ones.A proposed method combines advantages of using octree structure as search graph
(such as sparce free space representation) and hierarchical path planning (effective
reduction of graph size by clustering). Thus, an appreciable speed-up is achieved.},

programming. Research and design of such games is usually based on general learning
theories. Yet, computer programming poses specific types of difficulties to novice
programmers. Taking into account these particular characteristics and problems of
computer programming as a learning content in the design of programming games could
allow for producing games that are more suitable to the needs of novice programmers.
This paper first reports on a novice programmer problems analysis, to gain insight
into learners' specific difficulties. Then, a review of existing programming games
is presented to investigate how and to which extent these games deal with specific
programming problems. The results of these studies aim to contribute to the requirements
and ideation phases of a programming game design process, thereby informing a learning

noises and not allowed to move, is a psychological burden for patients. Children especially
have problems to lie still during the examination and sometimes exhibit intense fear
reactions. Therefore, children are frequently sedated before the examination. We introduce
the concept and implementation of a virtual reality (VR) game as a medication-free
alternative for children, aiming to reduce anxiety, stress, and boredom during MRI
examinations. Playing or just watching an animated space story in VR provides distraction
and relaxation to the patients. We pursued a child-centered, participatory design
process and derived design requirements from the results of two workshops with children
in a hospital school (N = 15) and a primary school (N = 14), as well as a focus group
test with a prototype. We propose VR games as a solution to enhance the well-being
of children during medical interventions and show a way to approach a user-centered
and targeted game design.},

an open-source game engine for embedding play with text messages, city data streams,
and the Internet of Things (IoT). City-specific games have the potential to affect
social issues, including to address regional economics and health disparities that
vary by zip code. However, collaboration in design is notoriously difficult - and
programming skills are often lacking in urban planners, artists, and ordinary residents.
Rather than propose a consumer app for mobile phones, this project investigates the
potential of coordinating play from a neighborhood server. More importantly, the authoring
tool seeks to democratize design by aligning the use of print and digital "cards"
in the design process to express feedback loops and interactive sequences without
requiring any traditional software coding experience. We argue that for game design
in particular, paper prototyping is especially important -- and that authoring tools
can expand participation by embracing a "card metaphor" to extend the power of paper
prototyping into online authoring tools. This work in progress is a nine-month case
study of using Hive Mechanic, including for public art, crowd-sourced mapping, and
a transmedia scavenger hunt.},

abstract = {Achieving realistic virtual humans is crucial in virtual reality applications and
video games. Nowadays there are software and game development tools, that are of great
help to generate and simulate characters. They offer easy to use GUIs to create characters
by dragging and drooping features, and making small modifications. Similarly, there
are tools to create animation graphs and setting blending parameters among others.
Unfortunately, even though these tools are relatively user friendly, achieving natural
animation transitions is not straight forward and thus non-expert users tend to spend
a large amount of time to generate animations that are not completely free of artefacts.
In this paper we present a method to automatically generate animation blend spaces
in Unreal engine, which offers two advantages: the first one is that it provides a
tool to evaluate the quality of an animation set, and the second one is that the resulting
graph does not depend on user skills and it is thus not prone to user errors.},

Currently, Space Vision is a digitally gamified version of an established visual acuity

that the engagement and usability of Space Vision must be improved to maintain attention
for repeated use. Though theories of human gameplay motivation provide the abstract
components necessary to transpose this test into an immersive gameplay experience,
they do not operationalise specific game design decisions for our target age group.

the aspects of games which have been utilized for personalization and which components
have been identified in game design frameworks as building blocks of games. We synthesize
the identified components into categories of game elements. We then propose PEAS,

of in-class digital feedback systems, we conducted a within-subjects study with 73

while instructors provided verbal feedback, peers provided feedback either on paper
or through a device. The study found that both methods yielded comments of similar
quality and quantity, but the digital approach provided additional ways for students
to participate and required less effort from the instructors. While both methods produced
similar behaviors, students held inaccurate perceptions about their behavior with
each method. We discuss design implications for technologies to support in-class feedback

abstract = {Graphically-rich applications such as games are ubiquitous with attractive visual
effects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offers a bridge between software applications
and end-users. However, various types of graphical glitches may arise from such GUI
complexity and have become one of the main component of software compatibility issues.
Our study on bug reports from game development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that
graphical glitches frequently occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade
the quality of graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated
testing techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test
sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These techniques
require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such as bugs causing
graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in automating the test
oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich applications. Specifically,
we propose GLIB based on a code-based data augmentation technique to detect game GUI
glitches. We perform an evaluation of GLIB on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports
available) and the result shows that GLIB can achieve 100% precision and 99.5% recall
in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application of
GLIB on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further demonstrates that
GLIB can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48 of 53 bugs reported by GLIB having
been confirmed and fixed so far.},

Without guidance on how in-game assessment affects player perceptions and experiences,
designers and researchers are in danger of making decisions that harm data quantity
and quality, and perceptions of privacy. We conducted a user study to understand self-report
collection from NPC dialogues and traditional in-game overlay questionnaires. Data
quality and player experience measures autonomy, curiosity, immersion, and mastery
did not differ significantly, although NPC dialogues enhanced meaning. NPC dialogues
supported an increase in data quantity through voluntary 5-point scales but not via
open responses; however, they also increased the perceived intimacy of shared information
despite comparable objective intimacy. NPC dialogues are useful to gather quantitative
self-report data. They enable a meaningful play experience but could facilitate negative
effects related to privacy.},

abstract = {Global software development is becoming increasingly popular. Working in geographically
distributed teams affords advantages to both employer and employee alike. Despite
this, distributed working remains a point of contention for many organisations, with
some claiming it unsuitable for complex collaborative work. Many argue that the complex
act of team sensemaking (the process by which a team develops an understanding of
a situation or problem) can only effectively be performed in co-located environments.
To investigate this assumption, we examine the communications of a geographically
distributed game development team. This global team communicates entirely via forums,
yet still manages complex sensemaking tasks asynchronously. We use thematic analysis
to investigate how themes develop during online conversations, and use speech act
sequences to explore how understanding is developed during these asynchronous conversations.
Our findings demonstrate how collective sensemaking occurs within a real-world, geographically

of game studies, development, design, and associated research methods, but far fewer

themes in the field around curricular efforts that consider the role of games as a
method to (1) advance research (broadly defined) through the act of making games;
(2) use games as tools for doing research; and (3) creatively present research topics
and findings through games. This paper presents a post-mortem analysis of two courses
that were designed, developed, and offered to graduate students at separate universities
with these topics in mind, describing their success, failure, and lessons learned.
One of these universities is largely focused on doctoral students in game studies,
while the other is focused on MFA students in game design, and both offer game-centric
MA programs, and also opened these courses to other graduate students in related fields.
By examining the design, development, and evaluation of these courses as a comparative
case study, the authors provide a practical narrative of best practice in the emerging
area of games as research creation tools and associated curriculum.},

abstract = {Phishing attacks are a major problem, as evidenced by the DNC hackings during the
2016 US presidential election, in which staff were tricked into sharing passwords
by fake Google security emails, granting access to confidential information. Vulnerabilities
such as these are due in part to insufficient and tiresome user training in cybersecurity.
Ideally, we would have more engaging training methods that teach cybersecurity in
an active and entertaining way. To address this need, we introduce the game What.Hack,
which not only teaches phishing concepts but also simulates actual phishing attacks
in a role-playing game to encourage the player to practice defending themselves. Our
user study shows that our game design is more engaging and effective in improving
performance than a standard form of training and a competing training game design
(which does not simulate phishing attempts through role-playing).},

we identify key theories from the literature and propose two hypotheses about the
cognitive processes?the "conditions"?underlying flow's phenomenology. We then describe
the mechanisms that facilitate the fulfillment of these conditions and propose a small
number of design heuristics for eliciting flow in video games. Finally, we consider
some of our model's implications for the traditional interpretation of the phenomenon
and discuss the need to test our framework with empirical studies.},

abstraction, reduced overhead, and multithreading capabilities. Once again, CG instructors
have to either use outdated models, or change the way they teach. Acknowledging the
divide between the development speed of GDEs, and the complexity and vastness of new
graphics APIs, we show how the use of a GDE can help students understand core CG concepts,
and still include shader-based programming, while low-level tasks are managed by the
engine itself.},

need to develop a STEM-literate future workforce [26]. This study presents a description
of preliminary findings from the development, implementation, and examination of an
after-school pilot project combining neuroscience education and the creation of playable
media for underserved high school students in Hayward, California.The program, developed
by university faculty, graduate students and the Institute for STEM Education, is
an interdisciplinary and collaborative way to combine neuroscience and design thinking.
Drawing on two existing university programs, the CSUEB Game Jam and Brain Bee, it
offers an after-school program that is engaging, content-rich, and transdisciplinary.
Combining neuroscience and design thinking into STEAM, the program also answers a
call by California Next Generation Science and Engineering Standards [21] for increased
integration of different disciplines in inquiry-based approaches.The evaluation research
study of the Brain Jam project was guided by questions of how this after-school program
was implemented and the consequences for student engagement. The study also looked
at the growth in science literacy and practice as well as design thinking. Preliminary
findings appear to support the effectiveness of this transdisciplinary, interactive,
and problem-centered approach. They suggest that "folding together" game design and
neuroscience was effective in supporting deeper thinking and understanding, and increased
student interest in both disciplines.},

industry has led to games not being as thoroughly influenced by accessibility standards
as most other facets of information and communication technology. As a result, individuals
with disabilities are unable to fully, if at all, engage with many commercial games.
This paper presents the findings of a pair of complementary empirical studies intended
to understand the current state of game accessibility in a grounded, real-world context
and identify issues and barriers. The first study involved an online survey of 55
gamers with disabilities to elicit information about their play habits, experiences,
and accessibility issues. The second study consisted of a series of semi-structured
interviews with individuals from the game industry to better understand accessibility's
situation in their design and development processes. Through quantitative and qualitative
thematic analysis, we derive high-level insights from the data, such as the prevalence
of assistive technology incompatibility and the value of middleware for implementing
accessibility standardization. Finally, we discuss specific implications and how these
insights can be used to define future work which may help to narrow the gap.},

assessed (offline) the player's Myers-Briggs personality type through a questionnaire,
inferred his player type based on the Demographic Game Design model (conqueror, manager,
wanderer, and participant), and propose how player type can enhance the player's experience
by informing the game on three distinct aspects: difficulty management, presentation
and depth of control over certain aspects of the game.To evaluate our approach, we
developed a videogame, Grim Business, asked players of different types to play under
different conditions and evaluated the experience using a questionnaire based on the
GameFlow model. Our results suggest that player immersion, and consequently enjoyment,
is higher when the game adapts to the player type.},

the exchange of information concerning the foundations of digital games, technology
used to develop digital games, and the study of digital games and their design, broadly
construed. The goal of the conference is the advancement of the study of digital games,
including but not limited to new game technologies, critical analysis, innovative
designs, theories on play, empirical studies, and data analysis.The guiding vision
for this year's conference is Creating Games from the Player and for the Player. The
role of the player has evolved from being viewed as a mere consumer to a participant
holding a key role within the game design, creation, and development processes. Such
participation may be direct, e.g. as an involved party in pre-deployment testing and
through active roles in support forums, or indirect through the continuous data collection
that is becoming increasingly important post-deployment.With this theme in mind, we
would like to promote and expand cutting-edge research, involving theoretical and
empirical studies from a wide variety of backgrounds, around the following topics:
modeling and understanding the player, user experience research, player driven and
data-driven content design and generation, mixed- initiative authoring, the role of
the player in the on-line communities, designing for and participating in e- sports
events, as well as gender and cultural aspects of digital games.},

abstract = {The state-of-the-art in software engineering for game engines, recommends the use
of a component-based software architecture for managing the entities in a game. A
component-based architecture facilitates the definition of new types of entities as
collections of components that provide basic pieces of functionality, providing a
flexible software that can adapt to changes in game design. However, such flexibility
comes with a price, both in terms of software understanding and error checking: a
game where entity types are just run-time concepts is harder to understand than one
with an explicit hierarchy of entity types; and error checking that, in a more traditional
inheritance-based architecture, would come from type safety at compile time is now
lost. To alleviate these problems, a component-based architecture employs blueprints,
external data files that specify the particular combination of components for every
entity type.In this paper we propose an extension to the component-based architecture,
substituting blueprints with a full fledged domain model in OWL, including a description
of the entities, its attributes and components, along with the messages they exchange.
We also describe authoring tools for building such a model and show how the model
improves software understanding and error checking.},

designs will interact with the world. Keyboard inputs and VGA outputs are a relatively
simple set of I/O interfaces that open up significant new potential for development
of game applications on the student's own computer designs. In this paper we describe
the curriculum of a computer design course that uses game design as a "carrot" to
encourage active student exploration and deeper understanding of computer architecture,

abstract = {Videogames are complex stimuli, and selecting games that consistently induce a desired
player experience (PX) in an experimental setting can be challenging. The number of
relatively high-quality games being released each year continues to increase, which
makes deriving a shortlist of plausible candidate games from this pool increasingly
problematic. Despite this, guidance for structuring and reporting on the game selection
process remains limited. This paper therefore proposes two approaches to game selection:
the first leverages online videogame databases and existing PX research, and is structured
with respect to widely-applicable videogame metadata. The second process applies established
game design theory to serve researchers when insufficient connections between desired
PX outcomes and recognisable game elements exist. Both methods are accompanied by
example reports of their application. The present work aims to assist experimental
researchers in selecting videogames likely to meet their needs, while encouraging
more rigorous standards of reporting in the field.},

to ameliorate boredom associated with repetitive rehabilitation exercises. However,
designing effective, appropriate, and engaging games for BI therapy is challenging.
Following a user-centered approach we created GaPBIT (Game Design Patterns for BI
Therapy), a prototype tool that leveraged design patterns to support designer-therapist
collaboration when ideating games for BI therapy. We observed the use of GaPBIT in
six game ideation workshops that involved game designers and therapists. The tool
effectively facilitated collaboration in the interdisciplinary teams. Findings also
suggested that information tools like GaPBIT support but do not replace informative
collaboration among designers and subject-matter experts (i.e., therapists in our
study). We argue that our findings and research methodology generalize to other domains
where communication and collaboration among interdisciplinary design teams are imperative
for designing "successful" games; i.e. games that meet the varied goals among stakeholders.},

guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related

games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood

we present seven guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in games. The
guidelines are designed to foster safe physical activity among older adults, thereby
increasing their quality of life.},

citizen and expert scientists working with our prototype interface for Foldit Drug
Design Mode (FDDM). First, we tested if the two groups are providing different feedback
when it comes to the usability of the prototype interface. Second, we investigated
how the difference between the two groups might inform a new game design. As expected,
the results confirm that experienced scientists differ from citizen scientists in
engaging their background knowledge when interacting with the game. We then provided
a prioritization list of background knowledge employed by the expert scientists to
derive design suggestions for FDDM.},

the highest rate of drops and failures. Its importance for a timely completion of
Computer Science college programs implies the need of employing innovative instructional
methods and technologies to improve student engagement and performance. This poster
presents an instructional method that leverages strategies from both flipped learning
and gamification. The flipped classroom has been shown to effectively support active
learning activities. Moreover, flipping a Data Structures classroom allows introducing
programming labs in class, which is not typical for the standard way of teaching the
course. However, the success of flipped learning depends crucially on the proper engagement
of students in and outside of class. Here gamification can help. Gamification, defined
as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, has shown promises in shaping
user behavior in desirable directions, which can be used to increase students' motivation
and engagement in the learning process. The poster describes a gamified flipped learning
approach and the author's experience and findings in using it in a Data Structures
course at a minority university. In the proposed method, the in-class work features
group problem solving and pair-programming labs. The employed gamification elements
include accruing points, virtual currency, rapid feedback, unlocking content, freedom
to fail, and social engagement. The measures used in assessing the effectiveness of
the proposed approach include students' grades, information about class attendance
and submission of lab assignments, and an attitudinal survey.},

through literature review and expert opinion from both the game experts, rehabilitation
physicians and therapists. This paper will discuss the development of the virtual

the principles and elements that has been identified. The focus of the study is to
develop a virtual reality game on dual cognitive task for stroke patients that combine
all the game elements, game type, virtual reality environment and also game theory
for dual cognitive task rehabilitation. The adoption of the correct rehabilitation

themes and features (e.g., real-world interaction, game mechanics) around G4H. We
found evidence of conceptual differences suggesting that a G4H perspective is not
simply the sum of game and health perspectives. At the same time, we found evidence
of convergence in stakeholder views, including areas where game experts provided insights
about health and vice versa. We discuss how this work can be applied to provide conceptual
tools, improve the G4H design process, and guide approaches to encoding G4H-related

For this study we examined three puzzle games, Portal 2, I-Fluid and Braid. The Player
Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) survey is used to measure player experience
following gameplay. Cognitive action provided within games is examined in light of
reported player experiences to determine the extent to which these activities influence
players' feelings of competence, autonomy, intuitive control and presence. Findings
indicate that the positive experiences are directly influenced by game activity design.
Our study also demonstrates the value of expert review in deconstructing gameplay
activity as a means of providing direction for game design that enhances the player

the sources of water and weather, respectively, but also enhance the importance of
food quality. To make players care for these issues, the game creates a direct impact
by using the happiness of people that is represent by the villagers. To reduce the
language barrier when sharing knowledge across the countries is needed, the game also
supports multi-language to make it more understandable to the player. This paper describes

abstract = {The Dream Coders Project aims at developing video games to facilitate learning of
introductory programming concepts with two ultimate goals. First, to produce a collection
of game-based assignments that faculty can use to teach introductory programming concepts,
even if they have no background in computer graphics or video game development. The
faculty should be able to adopt any of the assignments and integrate them into their
existing classes with minimal overhead. Second, to develop a framework for overcoming
the typical shortcomings of using video game-based assignments in introductory programming
classes: they are typically "pseudo" games that are neither fun nor playable outside
of class assignments. This paper discusses the first phase of the project-we designed
and implemented a traditional top-down Role Playing Game (RPG) where students play
the role of the hero, and can explore and extend a fantasy environment that is incomplete
in functionality. Through a series of programming assignments, students can add functionality
and increase the playability (and fun) of the game. The programming assignments are
independent from one another, so that the faculty can pick and choose specific ones
to integrate into their existing courses. The discussion in this paper focuses on
two perspectives: building the RPG game as a 10-week-quarter undergraduate independent
study course; and the process, schedule, and results from the project. As an independent
study course, the project was a success. We were able to deliver a completed RPG game
with multiple "quests" integrated as programming assignments. The paper concludes
with lessons learned from this project and a discussion of the pros and cons of using
a complete playable game for teaching introductory programming concepts.},

abstract = {Many people all over the world still suffer from the stress induced by quarantine
and social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak, and it is a topic of significance
to manage negative feelings and emotions when considering mental health and wellness.
Our questions are: "Can a game help people maintain mental health and wellness in
such a situation?" and "Will virtual escape from isolation in the game help people
feel better in reality?" Therefore, with the design concept of a "healing game", we
developed Daydream, a game that combines puzzles and interactive music-making experiences
with the design concept of a "healing game" to help players slow down, relax, and
imagine. In Daydream, players collect magic objects that can retrieve the main character's
memories and unfold her imagination, allowing players to enter a musical adventure.
While this research project is still in the early stage, we conducted a preliminary
user study and the feedback from the participant were generally positive to our design
concept and game design. We believe such a design concept of a 'healing game' would
be promising as an interesting research topic in serious games.},

While much previous work has focused on the measurement of student engagement or learning
at a gross level, we argue that new methods are necessary for measuring the alignment
of a game to its target learning goals at an appropriate level of detail to inform
design decisions. We present a novel technique that we have employed to examine alignment
in an open-ended educational game. The approach is based on examining how the game
reacts to representative student solutions that do and do not obey target principles.
We demonstrate this method using real student data and discuss how redesign might
be informed by these techniques.},

free grammars to generate a description of levels and a cellular automata inspired
process to generate the physical space. The generator proves successful at consistently
generating dungeon layouts that maintain completability at all times with sufficient
variation, when accounting for the occasional need for corrective actions. We conclude
that there is substantial value in hybrid approaches to automated level design and
propose a new heuristic by which to assess dungeon style level content.},

abstract = {In recent years, the games industry has made a major move towards data-driven development,
using data analytics and player modeling to inform design decisions. Data-driven techniques
are beneficial as they allow for the study of player behavior at scale, making them
very applicable to modern digital game development. However, with this move towards
data driven decision-making comes a number of ethical concerns. Previous work in player
modeling [45] as well as work in the fields of AI and machine learning [9, 53] have
demonstrated several ways in which algorithmic decision-making can be flawed due to
data or algorithmic bias or lack of data from specific groups. Further, black box
algorithms create a trust problem due to lack of interpretability and transparency
of the results or models developed based on the data, requiring blind faith in the
results. In this position paper, we discuss several factors affecting the use of game
data in the development cycle. In addition to issues raised by previous work, we also
raise issues with algorithms marginalizing certain player groups and flaws in the
resulting models due to their inability to reason about situational factors affecting
players’ decisions. Further, we outline some work that seeks to address these problems
and identify some open problems concerning ethics and game data science.},

and thus increase patient motivation and adherence to therapies. The design of this
category of games differs from others since it requires an understanding of the domain
of therapy that has to be addressed, as well as the necessary knowledge of game development.
Research in the literature has highlighted that there is a lack of a formal approach
that can allow a multidisciplinary team to be involved in the design of this category
of games. This paper adopts a semio-participatory approach to the design of therapeutic
digital games, which includes a multidisciplinary team and supports the different
profiles of professionals who take part in the whole design process. The approach,
called SemTh, was based on a) data from the literature, b) reports of the experiences
of professionals who have designed therapeutic games and c) an evaluation of researchers
in the areas of computation and health. SemTh was used to devise a therapeutic game
for children diagnosed with cancer. The approach was evaluated by the professionals
involved in the process of game construction and obtained positive results, mainly
with regard to understanding the domain, the needs of the target users and the therapeutic
aspects of the game.},

designers adapt a game prototype so that the resulting gameplay is as entertaining
as possible. In industry, the evaluation of a game is often based on costly playtests
with human players. It suggests itself to automate this process using artificial players
for the prediction of gameplay and outcome. In this paper, the feasibility of automatic
balancing is investigated for the card game top trumps using simulation- and deck-based
objectives. Additionally, the necessity of a multi-objective approach is asserted
by assessing the only published (single-objective) method. We apply a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm to obtain decks that optimise objectives developed to express
the fairness and the excitement of a game of top trumps, e.g. win rate and average
number of tricks. The results are compared with decks from published top trumps games
using the aforementioned objectives. The possibility to generate decks better or at
least as good as decks from published top trumps decks in terms of these objectives
is demonstrated. Our results indicate that automatic balancing with the presented
approach is feasible even for more complex games such as real-time strategy games.},

abstract = {Stronger engagement and greater participation is often crucial to reach a goal or
to solve an issue. Issues like the emerging employee engagement crisis, insufficient
knowledge sharing, and chronic procrastination. In many cases we need and search for
tools to beat procrastination or to change people's habits. Gamification is the approach
to learn from often fun, creative and engaging games. In principle, it is about understanding
games and applying game design elements in a non-gaming environments. This offers
possibilities for wide area improvements. For example more accurate work, better retention
rates and more cost effective solutions by relating motivations for participating
as more intrinsic than conventional methods. In the context of Information Retrieval
(IR) it is not hard to imagine that many tasks could benefit from gamification techniques.
Besides several manual annotation tasks of data sets for IR research, user participation
is important in order to gather implicit or even explicit feedback to feed the algorithms.
Gamification, however, comes with its own challenges and its adoption in IR is still
in its infancy. Given the enormous response to the first and second GamifIR workshops
that were both co-located with ECIR, and the broad range of topics discussed, we now
organized the third workshop at SIGIR 2016 to address a range of emerging challenges

took an iterative approach to designing the game, incorporating feedback from players
and biochemical experts alike. Feedback was gathered both before and after releasing
the game, to create the rules, interactions, and visualizations in Foldit that maximize
contributions from game players. We present several examples of how this approach
guided the game's design, and allowed us to improve both the quality of the gameplay

to players influences their level of immersion. The results suggested that game content
relevant to players' daily worries reduced their level of immersion. In addition,
the results indicated that players' personal factors, particularly the number of years

increasing the level of immersion.},

Using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization, we conduct efficient experiments
to identify game design characteristics---specifically those influencing difficulty---that
lead to maximal engagement. We study two games requiring trajectory planning, the
difficulty of each is determined by a three-dimensional continuous design space. Two
of the design dimensions manipulate the game in user-transparent manner (e.g., the
spacing of obstacles), the third in a subtle and possibly covert manner (incremental
trajectory corrections). Converging results indicate that overt difficulty manipulations
are effective in modulating engagement only when combined with the covert manipulation,
suggesting the critical role of a user's self-perception of competence.},

mostly driven by real-time growth of living micro-organisms. By outlining the design
process of Mould Rush, the paper aims to use the game as a case study to highlight
the opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed in creating games of this
nature, speed, and scale. In particular, we suggest that the slowness of microbial
growth may not necessarily compromise playing experience, but rather, enhance it instead.
We also highlight the complexity of human, biology and computer interaction pathways
that are involved in biotic gaming. And finally, we acknowledge the potential value
of designing formal evaluation models that would help in meaningful evaluation of
a 'biotic' gaming experience.},

abstract = {Game design activities support young people to acquire Computational Thinking (CT)
skills in an entertaining way. While the importance of CT is increasing, we still
lack empirical data on how cognitive functions support learning to program. The current
study is a step towards bridging this gap. We tested 48 participants aged 10-15 during
summer courses to see how programming skills are associated with cognitive processes.
Descriptive statistics of gaming and design elements of the participants' final projects
were correlated with measures of working memory, creativity, and arithmetic. Results
show that different concepts of CT applied in games were associated with separate
cognitive measures. The number of design elements (shape and structure of the game,
sound, visual design) correlated with both working memory and arithmetic skills; the
number of game elements (interactivity, mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) correlated
with creativity; whereas the complexity of the project was only predicted by age.
The overall evaluation of the project was associated with age and arithmetic skills.
Since the different concepts of CT were predicted by different cognitive skills, the
current study provides empirical evidence that CT is not a single homogenous skill,
but a set of subskills, with each part loading on different cognitive functions.},

abstract = {The lack of assessment tools to analyze serious games and insufficient knowledge on
their impact on players is a recurring critique in the field of game and media studies,
education science and psychology. Although initial empirical studies on serious games
usage deliver discussable results, numerous questions remain unacknowledged. In particular,
questions regarding the quality of their formal conceptual design in relation to their
purpose mostly stay uncharted. In the majority of cases the designers' good intentions
justify incoherence and insufficiencies in their design. In addition, serious games
are mainly assessed in terms of the quality of their content, not in terms of their
intention-based design. This paper argues that analyzing a game's formal conceptual
design, its elements, and their relation to each other based on the game's purpose
is a constructive first step in assessing serious games. By outlining the background
of the Serious Game Design Assessment Framework and exemplifying its use, a constructive
structure to examine purpose-based games is introduced. To demonstrate how to assess
the formal conceptual design of serious games we applied the SGDA Framework to the
online games "Sweatshop" (2011) and "ICED" (2008).},

in each region, and weak law enforcement in managing plastic waste has caused the
implementation of plastic waste management systems in Indonesia is less effective.
Based on research, recycle is most feasible expected to help to reduce the amount
of plastic waste effectively in Indonesia. The plastic waste recycling management
is a complicated matter, where the involvement of all relevant stakeholders can play
a crucial role in supporting policymakers in defining an effective and long-running
plastic waste management plan at the local level. On the other side, Serious Simulation
Game found to be useful for educating users through its engaging environment and experiencing
the decision. However, there is still very little Serious Simulation Games research
with the theme of waste, and no one has focused on plastic waste recycling management
learning for stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to develop a Serious Simulation
Game design that can be improved understanding of the sustainability system in managing
plastic waste recycling for stakeholders. This game provides the player in finding
the best scenario that results in the most volume of Plastic waste collected and encourage
increased net profit. Multiplayer game infrastructure implemented to allow interaction
between players. It enables the player to understand the different results for different
decisions taken both in collaborative and competitive mode. The preliminary model

work alongside existing, more broadly focused serious games design frameworks. The
framework utilises an inquiry-based approach that allows the serious game designer
to use key questions as a means to clearly outline instructional objectives with the
core-gameplay. The use of this design framework is considered in the context of a
small section of gameplay from an educational game currently in development. This
demonstration of the framework brings shows how instructional objectives can be embedded
into a serious games core-gameplay.},

especially disabled - people in learning and with reducing exclusive aspects within
and from education. Communication skills under an inclusive perspective are to be
understood as more than spoken or written word. Levels of languages used and alternative
modes of communication are to be explored and harnessed.However, game complexity and
technical constraints hamper the seamless integration in real world environments,
especially when addressing groups aside from the mainstream. Building on four design
challenges, we aim to develop an independently usable, user-friendly and user-oriented,
technically low-threshold game called Cologon that fosters communication skills and
takes into account the players diverse (dis)abilities, needs, and preferences - in
simple terms: an inclusive game.In this paper we present our iterative participatory
design process and the conceptual prototype. The results of an evaluation of this
prototype in a participatory game design workshop point to unique insights: participants
prioritised visual and audible cues above any use of language and one-device-per-player
combined with the choice of roles was a challenge for all participants and created
a creative communication experience.},

Fighting Gulliver, featuring an innovative game design that integrates cutting-edge

plays as the giant, while others without the two devices join forces to defeat the
giant. Players playing character roles other than the giant are not limited on a desktop
device. Entering the game through different devices results in different character
roles, skills, and user interfaces. As a result, Fighting Gulliver is a cross-platform
multiplayer online role-playing game (MORPG) with novel gaming experience and unique
game settings rarely found in previous works. Game balance design and a user study
are also discussed in this work.},

as medium for entertainment, including games used for training, education and critique.
Among this stretch we also find games that argue a particular point of view; to shape
attitudes and shift perspectives towards real-world concepts or objects. Unlike most
contemporary media to persuade games are unique in their interactive affordances;
providing players with the ability to evaluate given arguments to a system that responds,
and essentially allows the player to engage in an indirect discussion with the designer(s).
Although persuasion through games is not a new venue of research, the discipline unfortunately
still lacks practical game design strategies aimed to aid designers in maximizing
the persuasive potential of their games. The presented research is therefore concerned
with how to design for persuasive gameplay and what strategies (models, frameworks,
guidelines, methodologies, etc.) could support the designer throughout this design
process.},

Additionally, movement is a core interaction of these games. This makes the distances

requires video annotation which is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. To tackle
this problem we introduce geo-sociograms as a method to visualize distances between
players over time at a glance. We apply this method to existing data, showing that
it leads to many of the same insights as traditional video analysis while being less
time-consuming. A study indicates that geo-sociograms have the potential to help characterize
types of location-based games. Ultimately, we hope that geo-sociograms will help predict
movement patterns when using particular game design elements.},

ignore, are a fundamental element of game design. Still, little is known about how
secondary objectives affect player behavior. It is commonly believed that secondary
objectives such as coins or collectible items can increase a game's flexibility, replayability,
and depth. In contrast, we present results from analysis of two popular online Flash
games showing that secondary objectives can easily harm the retention of many players.
We support our findings with data collected from over 27,000 players through large-scale
A/B tests in which we measured play time, progress, and return rate. We show that
while secondary objectives can encourage long-term players to extend their playtime,
they can also cause many players to play for less time. By modifying secondary objectives
so that they reinforce the primary goal of the game instead of distracting from it,
we are able to avoid negative consequences and still maintain the retention of long-term
players. Our results suggest that secondary objectives that support the primary goal
of the game are consistently useful, while secondary objectives that do not support
the main goal require extensive testing to avoid negative consequences.},

themes: co-location in the dome context, interacting with dome interfaces, and designing
for exhibition. These themes present an argument for designing 'enveloping experiences'

Raptor using seven groups of three people showed that a sketching tool based on a

abstract = {While physical study abroad and exchange programs are proven methods for building
cross-cultural communication, there are many limitations on the number of people who
get to participate and how accessible such programs are to diverse populations. To
address such inequities of access and consider virtual alternatives and supplements
to traditional study abroad programs, a team of faculty and students collaborated
on making a game designed to facilitate both English-language learning and cross-cultural
communication through providing a virtual version of a trip to the United States.
This paper discusses the historical context enabling such a project to occur and then
discusses the process of building and deploying a game designed by US students for
a Russian audience of visually-impaired students at the Grot School in St. Petersburg,
Russia. The resulting text- and audio-based game demonstrates the potential of situated
user-centered game design as a pedagogical practice with learning outcomes both for
the student creators and the audience of student players. The resulting game was requested
by 11 other institutions. The results reported here highlight the ability of game
based learning to facilitate cross cultural communication, develop mutual understandings,
and build relationships between culturally diverse students on an interpersonal level.
It further reveals how the use of open source game creating tools provide a customizable
game platform for the development of ideas to improve intercultural competence in
the context of language learning (such as EFL) when other resources are not readily
available. The impact of this type of initiative is thus far greater than the created
object (the game): it illustrates the strong potential of games and game-making as
a method for advancing cultural discourse, an important prerequisite for effective
intercultural communication and documentation.},

to fill a gap left by the elimination of the computing curriculum in the local school
district. In our club, university faculty and students provide curriculum, tools,
and classroom tutoring for young novice programmers across the school district. Our
curriculum teaches programming through a series of exercises involving HTML, BASIC,
LOGO, and Processing (a graphics-oriented Java variant.) Contrary to some other approaches,
we present students initially with a low level, bare bones programming model and development
environment, then gradually increase the functionality and complexity. We find that
students readily grasp the simple, transparent initial model, then experience first-hand
the motivations for adding functionality (and complexity). Our cross-curricular programming
topics include graphic design, interactive fiction, computer generated poetry, mathematical
simulation, computational geometry, game physics, computer art, artificial intelligence,
video game development, and critical thinking. We provide examples of our curriculum,
student work, problems encountered, and how they were resolved.},

attention of educators as a potentially useful method to increase engagement, motivation

due to conflicting results of relevant studies. In our study, the effectiveness of
two most common GTs, badges (i.e., digital credentials for achievements) and leaderboards
(performance based digital rankings), on the academic performance and self-reported
motivation levels of students were investigated. Two experiments were conducted in
two 100% online undergraduate physics courses taught via Learning Management System
(LMS). In Experiment 1 (N=102), GTs were implemented in only the quiz scores (40%
of the course grade) through LMS, e.g. badges were awarded and leaderboards created
based on quiz scores. In Experiment 2 (N=88), both quiz and assignment scores (100%
of the course grade) were gamified, e.g. badges and leaderboards were based on both
quiz and assignment scores. Participants were randomly assigned into one of four groups:
badges-only, leaderboards-only, badges-with-leaderboards and control (i.e., no badges,
no leaderboards). Self-report questionnaire about students' attitudes and motivation
toward GTs were collected at the end of study. The results from both experiments demonstrated
that although most students showed positive attitudes towards badges and leaderboards
on the motivation questionnaire, neither badges nor leaderboards significantly affected
academic performance of students. This study suggests GTs may be useful in influencing
student motivation however, they are not effective in increasing student academic
performance.},

abstract = {Persuasive games exist for a wide variety of objectives, from marketing, to healthcare
and activism. Some of the more socially-aware ones cast players as members of disenfranchised
minorities, such as migrants, prompting them to 'see what they see'. In parallel,
a growing number of designers has recently started to leverage immersive technologies
to enable the public to temporarily inhabit another person, to 'sense what they sense'.
From these two converging perspectives, we hypothesize a still-uncharted space of
opportunities at the crossroads of games, empathy, persuasion, and immersion. Following
a Research through Design approach, we explored this space by designing A Breathtaking
Journey, an embodied and multisensory mixed-reality game providing a first-person
perspective of a refugee's journey. A qualitative study was conducted with a grounded
theory/open coding methodology to tease out empathy-arousing characteristics, and
to chart this novel game design space. As we elaborate on our analysis, we provide
insights on empathic mixed-reality experiences, and conclude with offering three design
opportunities: visceral engagement, reflective moments and affective appeals, to spur
future research and design.},

motivation and AI game-playing agents. We hypothesise that our approach could be used
to automatically predict PX across games and content types without relying on a human
player or designer. We conduct an exploratory study in level generation based on empowerment,
a specific model of intrinsic motivation. Based on a thematic analysis, we find that
empowerment can be used to create levels with qualitatively different PX. We relate
the identified experiences to established theories of PX in HCI and game design, and

taking the popular game, Find-the-Difference (FiDi), as a concrete example, we explore
new mobile game design principles and techniques for enhancing player's gaming experience
in personalized, automatic, and dynamic aspects. Unlike traditional FiDi game, where
image pairs (source image vs. target image) with M different patches are manually
produced by game developer and players may feel boring or cheat after practicing all
image pairs, our proposed Personalized FiDi (P-FiDi) mobile game may be played under
a new Snap &amp; Play mode. The player may first take photos with one s mobile device
(or select from one's own albums). Then, these photos serve as source images, and
the P-FiDi system automatically generates the counterpart target images by sequential
operations of aesthetic image quality enhancement, image patch and differentiating
style joint selection, music adaptation, dynamic difficulty level determination, and
ultimate automatic image editing with a rich set of popular differentiating styles
used in traditional FiDi game. Finally, the player enjoys the unique gaming with one's
own (instant) photos and music, and the freedom to have new gaming image pairs any
time. The user studies show that the P-FiDi mobile game is satisfying in terms of
player experience.},

system state within a finite time. This goal is challenged by several system features
such as arbitrary system states after faults, various process execution models, and
constrained process communication means. This work designs self-stabilizing distributed
algorithms from the perspective of game theory, achieving an intended system goal
through private goals of processes. We propose a generic game design for identifying
a maximal independent set (MIS) or a maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) among
all processes in a distributed system. From the generic game several specific games
can be defined which differ in whether and how neighboring players influence each
other. Turning the game designs into self-stabilizing algorithms, we obtain the first
algorithms for the MWIS problem and also the first self-stabilizing MIS algorithm
that considers node degree (including an analysis of its performance ratio). We also
show how to handle simultaneous moves of processes in some process execution models.
Simulation results indicate that, for various representative network topologies, the
new algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of MIS size and convergence rate.
For the MWIS problem, the new algorithms performed only slightly worse than centralized
greedy counterparts.},

i.e. 3D virtual environments that replicate existing urban areas. However, modeling
such spaces using traditional techniques is both too slow and too expensive. A good
solution is the use of procedural modeling techniques to automate the process. However
these techniques require large amounts of geospatial data, which are usually stored
in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).This paper presents a pipeline for the integration
of both geometric and semantic data from GIS data sources into procedural modeling
techniques used for the generation of 3D virtual urban environments. GIS data can
already be used in procedural modeling tools but these do not provide an easy and
uniform way to incorporate semantic information from different data sources. To solve
this problem, the proposed pipeline is capable of transforming semantic and geometric
information from different sources into 3D environments that replicate specific urban
areas.},

of various design elements with the example game Journey and its comparisons with
two other games. We also demonstrate with three student game design examples that
the schema can serve as a creativity support tool for designers, especially novices,
to conceptualize and plan a game that is driven by emotion and narrative.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a design methodology that we have termed Minimalist Game
Design. Minimalist games have small rulesets, narrow decision spaces, and abstract
audiovisual representations, yet they do not compromise on depth of play or possibility
space. We begin with a motivation for and definition of minimalist games, including
terms such as "rules," "mechanics," "control," and "interface," and illustrate the
importance of artificial design constraints. Using a number of examples, we show the
strengths of minimalist game elements in systems, controls, visuals, and audio. Adhering
to these constraints, these games feature a small set of mechanics and one core mechanic,
while still being sufficiently deep and allowing for player exploration and performance.
This depth comes from procedural methods, combinatorial complexity, probability, obfuscation,
challenge, or any combination thereof. Our methodology embraces principles of holistic
design, where there is no "filler," and where every element of the game contributes
to the play experience in some meaningful, deliberate way.},

abstract = {UPDATED---31 October 2015. This paper discusses an educational game for kindergarten
children to encourage collaboration between them. A game (Tata N Taro Adventure) was
designed for children from 4 to 6 years old to encourage collaborations between children
in remote and local environments. For this purpose, two classrooms are connected via
the Internet. The game content was designed to include multiple gameplays to support
a variety of collaboration types. Kinect was used as the interaction device for children.
The game was developed using unity game engine. The effectiveness of the game for
encouraging collaboration was examined by observing children's engagement levels and
interactions from the viewpoints of the collaboration scheme, game structure, and
the usage of the Kinect. The experiments were conducted at 3 kindergartens with 38
children participating in total. The results show that with the proposed game design,
children gained motivation to interact more with their peers and to compete healthily
with each other.},

maps that supports multiple participation types: manual reporting for people who are
highly motivated and have free time, walking for people who are highly motivated but
do not have free time, and game playing for people who are less motivated but have
free time. This design allows people to select a suitable way to participate, depending
on their motivation and time. We have developed a prototype system by integrating
deep learning techniques, a game design theory, and heatmap visualization.},

ad-hoc collaborative multi-touch gameplay. As our main contribution, we identified
particular gameplay aspects and formalized them in reference to formal elements of
gameplay: The game mechanics should support different scopes of involvement and make
use of spatial conflicts that relate to the player resources. The game should further
offer outcomes that can be achieved in continuous ad-hoc group gameplay. Based on
these criteria, we developed the multi-touch game Magic Garden. The case shows, how
the defined elements support game creation for ad-hoc collaborative multi-touch play.
As a final result, we propose to combine multiple separate mini-games in a mixed scenario
as a general approach for the creation of multi-touch games for large public displays.},

abstract = {Pervasive games have some unique properties that make them difficult to teach and
challenging to design. The best examples of pervasive games are all now unplayable,
having been specifically situated in both space and time. Pervasive games can be big,
comprised of large player communities and covering sizable geographies. They can take
a long time to play, sometimes lasting weeks or months. This makes them cumbersome
to iteratively playtest and inaccessible to most student game designers, who must
rely upon written accounts and sparse documentation to imagine the game experience.
In this paper we describe and reflect on the process of teaching pervasive game design
through a playful in-class exercise that we deployed in the Spring of 2016. We discuss
how teaching pervasive games in this manner can not only provide students insight
into this difficult design space, but can also create a unique context for designers
to iteratively test new large-scale game ideas.},

abstract = {With recent improvements in hardware performance, there has been an increased demand
in various industries, including game development, film production, and architectural
visualization, for realistic image rendering with global illumination (GI). But current
algorithms can not fulfill the strict speed and quality requirements of modern applications.
Many-light rendering solves this problem. By reducing light-transport simulation to
rendering the scene with many light sources, the many-light formulation offers a unified
view of the global-illumination scene. Unlike other GI algorithms, the quality-speed
trade-off in the many-light methods produces artifact-free images in a fraction of
a second while converging to the full GI solution over time.This course presents a
coherent summary of the state of the art in many-light rendering. It covers the basic
many-light formulation and recent work on its use for computing global illumination
in real time, on improving scalability with a large number of lights, on using the
many-light method as a basis for a full GI solution, and on rendering participating
media. The course focuses on the clarity of the underlying mathematical concepts as
well as on the practical aspects of the individual algorithms. One segment of the
course is devoted to the practical considerations of using many-light methods in the
Autodesk Cloud Rendering service.},

abstract = {Computer games are a very popular media today, spanning across multiple aspects of
life, not only leisure but also health or education. But despite their importance
their current level of accessibility is still low. One of the causes is that accessibility
has an additional cost and effort for developers that is in many cases unaffordable.
As a way to facilitate developers' job, this work proposes the creation of specialized
tools to deal with accessibility. The hypothesis defined was that it was possible
to produce tools that could reduce the input needed to adapt the games for people
with special needs but achieving a good level of usability, resulting in a reduction
of the cost and effort required. As game development tools and approaches are heterogeneous
and diverse, two case studies were set up targeting two different platforms: a high
level PC game authoring tool, and a low-level Android game programming framework.
Several games were developed using the tools developed, and their usability was tested.
Initial results depict that high usability levels can be achieved with a minimum additional
input from the game author.},

experience is not well understood, correlations between self-reports from players

Measurements of electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) allow making inferences
about player arousal (i.e., excitement) and are easy to deploy. This paper reports
a case study on HR and EDA correlations with subjective gameplay experience, testing
the feasibility of these measures in commercial game development contexts. Results
indicate a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.01) between psychophysiological arousal
(i.e., HR, EDA) and self-reported gameplay experience. However, the covariance between
psychophysiological measures and self-reports varies between the two measures. The
results are consistent across three different contemporary major commercial first-person

abstract = {The Uncharted series of video games for the PS3 have been recognized by their distinct
cinematic gaming experience and high quality graphics. Although the core game mechanics
are centered around exploration and combat; and less on water game play, water has
still been a major design element of the game. The complexity of the game mechanics
and rendering of the water has increased over the three games in the series. The range
of water types goes from simple puddles, pools to lakes and rivers, and, finally an
ocean storm environment. The games art style is realistic, but not fully photo-realistic
and the water rendering has to match the style. Our water shader uses general optical
principles but adds artistic controls to realize the style of the game. One of the
biggest challenges we solved was processing and rendering water with dramatic movement
and striking shading while using a small portion of the available resources (memory,
SPU and GPU). The water system runs in parallel with other game systems and everything
is running at 30 fps. In Uncharted 3, the water system was used to drive a cruise
ship, in which the whole level resided and thus became a central element of the gameplay.
The water would drive the cruise-ship which in turn moves the player, enemies, effects
and physics objects. In addition there were levels with swimming in rough water, flooding
water, crashing waves and floating platforms that had their own technological challenges.
Our engine uses different render engines depending on the type of water. All of these
engines are procedural systems and, because of the game design, not one uses real-time
physics simulations. One renders non-LOD meshes with calm and semi-moving water bodies
(rivers, lakes, and puddles), another uses a hierarchical LOD system with displacement
for open bodies of water, like the ocean, and the last uses a skinning mechanism with
particles for the flooding events.},

abstract = {With advancements in network technology and cost-efficient hardware, developers have
begun placing servers throughout the world. These servers reside at the edge of cloud
network infrastructures and vastly improved network quality. However, many locations
in the world are still distant when accessing these edge servers. Further, massively
multiplayer online games can strain edge server resources with additional hardware
not available at the desired location.In this paper, we explore the benefits of adapting
a hybrid peer-to-peer network built to communicate with edge servers. In modern development
of massively multiplayer online game topology, developers choose a traditional server
and client model. The central server is the focus of network optimization with emphasis
on adding additional hardware and creating multiple instances of the gaming virtual
world. With edge servers, additional hardware is not always an option, and we require
an innovative approach to the problem.Prior work has practically ruled out peer-to-peer
network topology for games due to poor latency and high variation in connection strength.
This has resulted in the overall avoidance of peer-to-peer network design. However,
adding an edge server to the equation, and reducing the physical distance of client
connections to this system, may improve the stability of a peer-to-peer network.We
propose Avatar Fog as a novel solution for forming a hybrid peer-to-peer cluster of
nodes using game design to decide network topology rather than the physical structure
of the client and server locations. We place emphasis on improvements to latency between
players participating in common gameplay, which is players participating in similar
objectives within the virtual world.A key element to the success of such a system
is within ideal cluster formation. We look at interactions within the virtual world,
rather than the physical connections of clients and servers to determine optimal cluster
formation. We propose a novel solution to this cluster formation by grouping clients
together using common gameplay, rather than virtual world positioning.We compare this
solution to the traditional server and client topology analyzing the effects on latency
and server resources. We conclude that Avatar Fog improves latency and server resources
over the traditional server and client model and dispels the myth that peer-to-peer
networks for massively multiplayer online games are unusable.},

abstract = {Brainstorming is an important part of creative design, related to exploring the associativity
of different ideas and the combination of their parts. Previous work has investigated
social interactions, productivity, techniques, and quality of brainstorming activities.
The paper contributes to this body of work by studying the design affordances of brainstorming
toolkits, and the relationship between idea associations and brainstorming. We examined
21 brainstorming toolkits designed for creative brainstorming within the context of
game design, which led us to four tiers of design affordances that specify the supportive
qualities of toolkits for brainstorming. To gain further insights into the use of
tools, we surveyed game jams participants about their brainstorming activities and
the use of tools at Global Game Jam 2017. We found a large number of participants
using traditional stationery to aid brainstorming and a common usage of mind mapping
and rearranging post-it notes. These findings inform our discussion of how idea creation
is leveraged by a hybrid use of traditional and digital tools.},

an estimated additional 386,000 residents by 2041. Plan Your Brisbane was available

was particularly successful in engaging residents in the usually difficult to reach
18--24 and 25--34 age demographics. Plan Your Brisbane contributes to the game design
community by demonstrating that games can facilitate civic engagement across all age
demographics, even on complex issues such as city planning. This paper introduces

abstract = {Modern video game development activities have become as specialized as movie-making
activites. Gifted story-writers, artists, and animators have replaced programmers
in most content creation activities. However, there is still one area where computer
programmers play a big role. Stories, characters, and events are still controlled
by scripts that are written in "C-like" languages. Therefore, scripting the video
game content usually requires a high level of programming knowledge. Some scripting
is simple, such as specifying specific game objects. However, in order to take advantage
of knowledge learned during game play, authors need to be able to specify dynamic
game objects. This often requires authors to create complex definitions, which are
composed of a series of variable assignments in programming languages. In this paper,
we show how these definitions can be replaced by a more natural mechanism, which we
call descriptions. We also present the results of a user study that shows that authors
with no programming skills can use descriptions more effectively than definitions
and that the authors prefer descriptions.},

from scratch, established instructional design principles (IDPs) can be adopted so
as to ensure the efficacy of SGs. The use of IDPs may enable educators, who are well-informed
about the process of designing instructions, to be involved in designing SGs. In the
literature, several SG authoring tools that remove the need for programming have been
proposed. Nonetheless, the complex process of game design and development will still
impede the potential of authoring tools. To gain a deeper understanding of how IDPs
have been integrated in SG design models, we have conducted a systematic literature
review. With the use of four databases, 165 unique articles were retrieved. After
a meticulous filtering process, eight were critically analysed. Results thereof allowed
us to make informed recommendations on the integration of IDPs within SG authoring
tools.},

14 interviews and employed grounded theory methods to unpack their experiences. We
found that audio games enriched their life through creativity, play, and social exchange.

analyse human behavior during epidemics of an infectious disease. The experiment used
a two-dimensional computer game representing an epidemic scenario, linked to an agent-based
simulation of an epidemic spreading through a large population. 230 participants played
the game and completed question-naires about their characteristics in relation to
a psychological model of health behaviour, Protection Motivation Theory. The results
show that participants responded to increasing infection load in their local neighbourhood
by reducing their social contacts, as they would be expected to do in reality. However,
there was no correlation between the strength of this response and a number of psychological
factors that are known to be associated with health protective behavior in the real
world. This suggests that participants might not have responded to the game in the
same way they would respond to a real epidemic. We discuss possible explanations for
this mismatch, drawing on ideas from experimental behavioral economics, psychology,
computer game design, and the study of virtual worlds, and suggest ways in which our
experimental methodology could be improved to produce a more realistic response.},

abstract = {Whenever someone chooses to study instead of going to a party, or forgo dessert after
dinner, that person is exercising self-control. Self-control is essential for achieving
long-term goals, but isn't easy. Games present a compelling opportunity to engage
in tasks that allow a player to exercise and improve self-control, and consequently
provide data about a person's cognitive capacity to exert self-control. However, exercising
self-control can be effortful and depleting, which makes incorporating it into a game
design that maintains engagement and quality of experience a challenge. We present
the design of game mechanics for exercising and improving self-control, and an initial
study that effectively demonstrates that games can be designed to engage a broad level
of self-control processes without negatively affecting player engagement and experience.
Our results also show that player performance is connected to trait-level self-control.
We discuss how (for example) players with low trait self-control can therefore be
identified, and games intended to improve or exercise self-control can dynamically
adapt to this information.},

abstract = {CSCW is now an annual conference and, for the first time ever, it is taking place
outside of North America -- this year in China. Despite this change in timing and
location, we are pleased to report that the number of submissions for 2011 was in
the same range as last year. Moreover, following the United States, China was the
second largest contributing nation with 22 submissions.In total, we received 264 papers
and notes. These ranged across many different areas, including: designs for new communication
and collaboration applications; new interaction techniques for novel hardware like
tabletops and public displays; studies of groupware deployment and use, especially
in the realm of new social media like micro-blogging and social networking sites;
and methods for analyzing social interaction. These submissions addressed a wide range
of applications domains, including: healthcare, rural areas, online gaming, mobile
computing, preschool, colleges, community workers, and global software development.
We think you will be impressed with the final line-up of 58 submissions that made
it into CSCW 2011.Full Papers (10 pages) and Notes (4 pages) submissions were reviewed
using the same process by the same Program Committee (PC). Much of our work is multidisciplinary
and a wide range of expertise is needed in the overseeing program committee to ensure
all submissions are fairly reviewed. Therefore, our committee consisted of established
and rising researchers as well as practitioners from academia, corporate research
laboratories, and consultancies. It included computer scientists, psychologists, designers,
engineers, sociologists and linguists. Among them, they had deep knowledge of various
domains ranging from game design to science and technology studies, applied to the
critical analysis and design of technologies for work and for leisure, used on the
move with mobile devices or at a desk on personal computers.We had 40 Associate Chairs
(ACs) as the CSCW 2011 PC evaluating the 264 submissions -- 188 full papers and 76
notes. In order to simultaneously front-load some of the PC meeting work and increase
the diversity of reviews for each submission, we modified the traditional AC allocation
process: each submission was assigned a primary AC (1AC) as well as a secondary AC
(2AC) up front. The 1AC and 2AC were allowed to consider desk rejection if there were
technical problems with a submission (e.g. formatting) or if it was completely out
of scope for the conference. Desk rejection had to be based on agreement between the
two ACs and the PC chairs -- otherwise, the submission went into the review process.
The 1AC and 2AC worked together to find a minimum of three external reviewers. Following
submission of the external reviews, the ACs initiated a discussion among the reviewers,
if needed, to resolve conflicting views. The 1ACs and 2ACs then completed a metareview
summarizing the reviews and provided detailed comments with a recommendation for acceptance,
rejection, and/or a request for additional input from the authors, which the authors
were encouraged to provide through a rebuttal procedure.Following this, the reviewers
and ACs were asked to consider the authors rebuttal and change their review and/or
score if the rebuttal gave reasons to do so. In early November 2010, the PC met for
2 days in Mountain View, California. Submissions without a single positive review
were flagged for automatic rejection, leaving 133 submissions to discuss. All had
to be presented by their ACs: we did not auto-accept submissions. While the ACs who
read the submission made the final recommendation, the decision process was highly
visible so that all of the 40 program committee attendees could apply the same standards
to their own decisions. ACs were encouraged to discuss at the committee meeting any
submission that they thought had merit including those not originally assigned to
them or for which they had acted as a 2AC. As a result, many more submissions were
discussed than were finally accepted.In total, the PC and 1,021 external reviewers
spent countless hours providing feedback to the authors. After this rigorous process,
a total of 58 submissions - 45 full papers and 13 notes -- were accepted for publication
in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 22%. A subcommittee
discussed and selected 21 of the 58 accepted submissions to be considered for special
recognition in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. SIGCHI rules
require that only 5% of submissions be nominated for best paper, with only 1% eventually
getting the award. The aforementioned list of 21 accepted submissions was therefore
reduced to 10 papers and 4 notes for consideration. Of these, 2 papers and 1 note
were recognized as Best of CSCW 2011, while the remaining were awarded an honorable
mention. These submissions are marked with small icons in the table of contents.},

through entertainment, being a promising solution for multicomponent training and
fall prevention in older adults. Even though seniors may enjoy playing, game design
is often not suited to this age group, which hinders interaction and user experience.
Therefore, we developed a motion-based interactive game for motor-cognitive training
in older adults, based on typical exergames, dance and Tai Chi. New forms of interaction
based on inertial sensors and movement were included and tested with eight older adults
in multiple sessions, during which usability and user experience were evaluated. People
found the exergame fun, even though some challenges related to interaction were reported.
Despite the challenges, people learned how to use the system and interaction has gradually
became easier. In-game strategies to support interaction are required to encourage
autonomous use devoid of supervision.},

abstract = {Serious games usually refer to games used for purpose other than entertainment. Designing
serious games for learning proves to be a very difficult task, as it requires knowledge
not only about the content, but also about game design and pedagogy. Therefore there
have been efforts to create collections of design patterns that help to create initial
designs or improve existing ones. However those collections neglect the role of social
interactions within games. But integrating social interaction as a core mechanic of
a serious game can massively improve the game along several dimensions. In this paper
we want to show how social interactions can enrich serious games. Furthermore we describe
several patterns with concrete examples on how to achieve this exactly.},

X10/Fortress/Chapel from IBM/SUN/Cray [Weiland 2007], Intel's CT/RapidMind [McCool

languages do great things in simplifying parallel implementation of code, extensions
beyond that are limited. The primary exception to this is VSIPL++ which implements
several high level functions useful to the signal processing community. While most
of these languages can be used to implement graphics or game related algorithms if
necessary, none of them attempt to provide a platform that makes such development
particularly easy. On the other hand, high level engines such as Renderman and Unreal
provide the wanted abstractions but with little or no guarantees about extensibility,
portability, or parallel performance. Our research focuses on adapting the parallel
VSIPL++ API from the signal processing community to the graphics and game development
environment.},

use "Alberto's Gravimente Toys", everyday life objects (e.g. inflatable bat) which
incorporate different sensors that are able to detect users' input actions. The game
lets children move around the physical space (indoors and outdoors), allowing simultaneous
cognitive and motor exercise. Our research also aims at finding new principles by
which to conceive technological tools for children, connecting both virtual and physical
realities, in direct proximity, and within different contextual environments. Children
were involved in the design process from the very beginning, helping to improve the
game design and usability. We were also interested in studying children attitude while
playing (e.g. individual/collaborative). Three user evaluation sessions are described
and the corresponding results are discussed.},

of interactive systems. It grew out of an University course titled A Pattern Approach
to Action Game Design, which was offered as an elective in the Creative Technologies
program at Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, in 2011. We sketch out
the idea of design patterns and describe our experiences with the process of using
them for designing oldschool action games, that is, finding patterns, making a language,
using it for creating several game designs and realizing one of these designs collaboratively.
We discuss the concept of the course and present our pattern language and the game
we made. While the language is arguably more like a patchy pattern collection, the
various game designs quite loose and the realized game unfinished, the process was
challenging and intense, and offered students a new perspective on design. In the
spirit of design patterns, we only did what the task at hand required, not artificial
exercises. We attempted to connect theory and practice in a natural, direct way as
we presented, discussed and used everything we did in order to continue our journey.
Our course was not aimed at fixed or frozen products, but on a process that was constantly
in flux through collaboration by people who interact and share a common pattern language,
use, test, revise and refine it while moving on.},

source for designers to inspire the creation of game concepts. A question that often
arises is how to deal with large amounts of collected information, or more specifically,
game ideas generated by children and offered via video snippets as inspirational source
for game ideation. The challenge lies in not only working with the 'obvious' observations
in the videos, but also thinking about underlying issues (such as cultural issues)
or processing them in a more structured way. In a study with multimedia design and
technology students (future game designers), we explored the application of and experiences
with two approaches, i.e., memoing and lenses, for handling player-generated game
ideas within a 2-hour game idea jam. The findings show that the two proposed approaches
hold potential for different scopes of ideation (e.g., broadening or narrowing the
scope of ideas).},

abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in all over the world. This disability
greatly impacts the stroke patients' daily life activities. Thus, rehabilitation exercises
are essential for post stroke patients to restore their lost functions gradually for
daily life activities. Traditional rehabilitation exercises do not motivate the post
stroke patients as they are normally humdrum and required expensive equipments. Therefore,
this paper presents the development of low --cost motivating webcam colour based visual
tracking augmented reality (AR) system with biofeedback for upper-limb post stroke
rehabilitation therapy. Augmented Reality is a novel form of human-computer interface
which overlay the computer-generated information on the real world environment rather
than replaces it. In the developed AR system, two games; Ping Pong Rehab (PPR) and
Balloon Collection Rehab (BCR) are created based on game design principle. PPR game
trains shoulder and arm muscles during rehabilitation therapy whilst BCR game trains
shoulder, arm and forearm muscles. Both games have been built and integrated with
Biograph Infiniti software to monitor the muscles' performance. The integrated system
will obtain the biofeedback EMG signals from patients that will be utilised for future
developments. It allows the patients to monitor their arms and muscles movements in
real time on the display screen via low-cost webcam. The system aims for home based
rehabilitation system and friendly used by patients themselves. The developed integrated
system has tested with able subject and it worked perfectly during the test.},

In this work, we studied the impact of recruitment within human computation games,
using two experiments. First, we compared voluntary recruitment versus paid recruitment
with different compensation levels. We found that the highest paid players completed
more levels (i.e. achieved a higher volume of completed tasks) and reported greater
engagement than both volunteers and players paid less while volunteers completed levels
of higher difficulty (i.e. achieved a higher quality of completed tasks) than paid
players. Additionally, we also varied both recruitment strategy and the game's design
and found no interaction effects, suggesting that while differences exist between
volunteer and paid players, experimental changes do not impact those players differently.},

While prior work has shown these to be effective in controlled settings, there has
been little work investigating their efficacy in classrooms. We conducted a 5-week
case study with 17 students aged 15-18, investigating students' sentiments toward
two strategies for debugging and code reuse, students' use of scaffolding to execute
these strategies, and associations between students' strategy use and their success
at independently writing programs in class. We found that while students reported
the strategies to be valuable, many had trouble regulating their choice of strategies,
defaulting to ineffective trial and error, even when they knew systematic strategies
would be more effective. Students that embraced the debugging strategy completed more
features in a game development project, but this association was mediated by other
factors, such as reliance on help, strategy self-efficacy, and mastery of the programming
language used in the class. These results suggest that teaching of strategies may
require more explicit instruction on strategy selection and self-regulation.},

however, designing games with this goal poses unique challenges. One way developers
have attempted to introduce ethical choices into their games is by creating game systems
that evaluate the players' moral actions, often representing them through a linear
scale such as a "karma meter." At the same time, these ethical systems often work
contrary to the design goals of the game by taking player choices that are framed
as ethical and reducing them to strategic decisions. The aim of this paper is to build
off the work that has already been done in game design and ethics in order to evaluate
effective and ineffective approaches to creating engaging ethical systems in games.
In particular, this paper will look at the use of intentional ambiguity as a method
of encouraging ethical decision making while deterring purely instrumental player
choices.},

some hubs at Global Game Jam 2021. We investigated the participation of LGBTQIA+ people
at the Global Game Jam 2021, aiming to understand their perspectives and the potential
challenges around any prejudice or discrimination they may face during the game jams.
We combined quantitative and qualitative research methods. First, we used a survey
to collect quantitative (closed-ended questions) and qualitative (open-ended questions)
data. The second part consisted of online interviews with some of the respondents
from the survey. After analyzing the collected data, we provided a set of recommendations
for structure and organization, aiming at a more inclusive and welcoming environment
to LGBTQIA+ participants, besides increasing the participation of this public. The
recommendations are: Organize diversity-focused game jams and diversity-focused Global
Game Jam hubs; make every participant aware of the code of conduct; foster collaboration

production. Specifically, the chapters are: 1)&nbsp;an overview of the use of coding within
media departments nationwide; 2)&nbsp;a literature&nbsp;review and analysis of coding pedagogical
discourse as it relates to the liberal arts; 3) a discussion of why journalism and

abstract = {Educational games have the potential to engage students deeply with a particular topic,
because they allow children to actively participate in the learning process rather
than just being passive observers. However, the design of educational games can be
challenging because serious objectives have to be brought in line with a satisfying
gameplay experience. Furthermore, great care has to be taken that the usability of
the game does not interfere with the underlying educational goals. This paper discusses
the design of DOGeometry, a learning game which combines problem-solving tasks with
artistic expression to teach elementary school children the basics of geometric transformations.
We evaluated the game design by observing children and automatically logging all user
events and report the insights which we gained from analyzing the gathered data not
only by statistical means but also through visualizations of gameplay data. The visualizations
proved to be extremely helpful to look behind the numbers and to explore the player
behavior in more detail.},

abstract = {Playing exertion games with others can be engaging. However, players with different
physical skill levels competing against each other can experience reduced engagement
because they are either not challenged enough, or challenged too much. Balancing methods
can address this; however, there is only limited understanding of balancing in exertion
games. In this paper, we identify two distinct dimensional balancing techniques: "internal
adjustment" and "external adjustment". We report results from a study where we measured
player engagement after applying these adjustments to a digital table tennis game
and the traditional table tennis game, finding two disengagement factors: "unexpected
physical challenges" and "unacceptable competitive advantage". Based on these factors
we derived a set of exertion game design considerations. We conclude that applying
digital technology to a physical game can change the required skill level to play
the game, and this can affect the impact of these adjustments on player engagement.
These results enhances our understanding of balancing in exertion games, supporting
the benefits of playing exertion games with others.},

in how gameplay can promote empathy and encourage reflection through "serious experience".
However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious
experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student
game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired
curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The
entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing
by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play
interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods,

abstract = {A particular challenge of the game design process is when the designer is requested
to orchestrate dissimilar elements of games such as visuals, audio, narrative and
rules to achieve a specific play experience. Within the domain of adversarial first
person shooter games, for instance, a designer must be able to comprehend the differences
between the weapons available in the game, and appropriately craft a game level to
take advantage of strengths and weaknesses of those weapons. As an initial study towards
computationally orchestrating dissimilar content generators in games, this paper presents
a computational model which can classify a matchup of a team-based shooter game as
balanced or as favoring one or the other team. The computational model uses convolutional
neural networks to learn how game balance is affected by the level, represented as
an image, and each team's weapon parameters. The model was trained on a corpus of
over 50,000 simulated games with artificial agents on a diverse set of levels created
by 39 different generators. The results show that the fusion of levels, when processed
by a convolutional neural network, and weapon parameters yields an accuracy far above
the baseline but also improves accuracy compared to artificial neural networks or
models which use partial information, such as only the weapon or only the level as
input.},

evolving intuitive understandings to more explicit formalized structures that would
support transfer of knowledge to other contexts. In Thought and Language, Vygotsky
(1986) discusses the potential for leveraging intuitive understandings from everyday
experience ("spontaneous concepts") with instructed scientific concepts to build robust
understandings. The SURGE project (Scaffolding Understanding by Redesigning Games

formal physics representations and visualizations (see Figure 1 (a) for a snapshot).

evaluating the game design and user experience. This is particularly important for
mobile games as an alternative game is always just an easy download away. However,
engagement is a subjective concept and usually requires fine-grained highly disruptive
interviews or surveys to determine accurately. In this paper, we present EngageMon,
a first-of-its-kind system that uses a combination of sensors from the smartphone
(touch events), a wristband (photoplethysmography and electrodermal activity sensor
readings), and an external depth camera (skeletal motion information) to accurately
determine the engagement level of a mobile game player. Our design was guided by feedback
obtained from interviewing 22 mobile game developers, testers, and designers. We evaluated
EngageMon using data collected from 64 participants (54 in a lab-setting study and
another 10 in a more natural setting study) playing six games from three different
categories including endless runner, 3D motorcycle racing, and casual puzzle. Using
all three sets of sensors, EngageMon was able to achieve an average accuracy of 85%
and 77% under cross-sample and cross-subject evaluations respectively. Overall, EngageMon
can accurately determine the engagement level of mobiles users while they are actively
playing a game.},

to help teachers learn how to program games and teach programming to middle school
students using a guided discovery approach. In the first PD course (n=58), a wholly
teacher-directed approach was used. In the other PD course (n=54), a guided discovery
approach was employed. I found three major differences between the groups. First,
the descriptions of the games varied significantly based on the type of instruction,
leading us to believe that teachers were taking more ownership of their creations.
Second, the teachers who were taught with a guided discovery approach were able to
work at a quicker pace, with less assistance, and ultimately were able to more quickly
apply those skills to more complex games and simulations within the course of the
professional development. Third, it also appears that this guided discovery teaching
methodology is similarly impacting changes in pedagogy when these newly trained teachers
use Scalable Game Design in the classroom. Students in classrooms where teachers were
taught using guided discovery methods were more likely to go beyond the curricular
materials when building their own games. This appears to indicate that these approaches
to training will translate to changes in classroom practice, enabling teachers to
more readily employ a guided discovery approach in their own teaching efforts},

abstract = {The Foundations of Digital Games is a unique conference that brings together researchers
and practitioners from computer science, education, design, cultural studies, and
other disciplines. Games research draws ideas and methods from these disciplines,
and the interaction of researchers broadens our horizons as we examine games as technical
and social artifacts.Papers submitted to the conference describe novel techniques
and the latest research on games. We identified seven theme areas and invited authors
to submit their papers to one of the specialized tracks. The tracks identified for
FDG 2010 were artificial intelligence, computer science and games education, game
design, game studies, graphics and interfaces, infrastructure (databases, networks,
security), and learning in games. Papers that did not fit into any of the identified
tracks could also be submitted to the general track to be reviewed by researchers
from different disciplines.Each of the tracks had their own program committee members
and their own track chair. Paper reviews were handled in a multi-stage process. First,
the track chairs read through all the papers submitted to their own track. Papers
that were not suitable for the track they were submitted to were moved to a different
track with the agreement of both track chairs and authors were notified of the move.
Second, the track chairs assigned reviewers to each paper. Third, for papers where
there was a disagreement among reviewers, reviewers were asked to re-examine the paper
and additional reviewers were asked to provide feedback. Fourth, the reviews themselves
were reviewed by the track chairs. Fifth, all the papers were discussed in an all
track chairs meeting where track chairs presented their recommendations. Finally,
any borderline papers were once again analysed by the program chair before a final
decision was made.While no review process is perfect, we have implemented a thorough
and fair review system to ensure papers from different disciplines are appropriately
reviewed. Each paper had at least three reviews, and two thirds of the papers had
four or more reviews. We received the largest number of submission in the game design
track followed by an almost equal number of submissions in the game studies track
and learning in games track.There were a total of 94 papers submitted. Of those submissions,
32 were accepted for presentation at the conference (32/94 = 34%). A further 12 short
papers were submitted as preliminary work, and of those 3 were accepted for presentation
at the conference (3/12 = 25%). All the accepted papers and short papers appear in
the conference proceedings.As part of FDG, we also organized the FDG Doctoral Consortium,
intended primarily for beginning PhD students who intend to pursue a career in academia.
There were 17 extended abstracts submitted to the doctoral consortium, and of those
8 were selected for presentation at the conference (8/17 = 47%). PhD students who
were accepted to the doctoral consortium received a full scholarship to cover their
travel costs and conference costs.Beyond the paper presentations, FDG 2010 incorporates
invited talks both from academia and industry, in-depth tutorials providing hands-on
experience, and panels examining different aspects of games. We also have three workshops
that are co-located with FDG: Intelligent Narrative Technologies III, Procedural Content
Generation in Games, and Teaching Aesthetics in Game Design.},

both to gain from peer feedback and to criticize their peers' work. This paper explores
how to more effectively scaffold this exchange such that peers more deeply engage
in the feedback process. Within a game design course, we introduced different processes
for feedback receivers to write questions to guide peer feedback. Feedback receivers
wrote four main types of guiding questions: improve, share, brainstorm, critique.
We found that "improve'' questions tended to lead to better feedback (more specific,
critical, and actionable) than other question types, but feedback receivers wrote
improve questions least often. We offer insights on how best to scaffold the question-writing
process to facilitate peer feedback exchange.},

We observed three important trends or tensions in audio game research. Firstly, audio
games research depended heavily on technological advancements during the last two
decades. Secondly, most studies about audio games were conducted with novices to audio
games in lab situations, that is, based on artificial situations and not on real gamers
and their genuine experience. Thirdly, the audio game design process per se has been
greatly neglected in the literature so far. We conclude the paper by discussing design

of gamification and the use of OneUp Learning, a platform aimed at gamifying academic
courses. OneUp is aimed at encouraging students' out-of-class practicing and increasing
their overall engagement in the course through employing game design elements. The
platform is course-independent and highly configurable, allowing the instructor to
turn on and off a number of gamification features, such as avatars, points (challenge
and skill points), leaderboards, skill boards, a progress bar, content unlocking,
goal-setting, badges, virtual currency, duels, chat, etc. For using OneUp, an instructor
has to provide practice exercises and to specify the gamification elements to be used.
Apart from the standard question types, OneUp supports Parson's problems and dynamic
problems (e.g. programming problems). The workshop proceeds in two sessions. In the
first session we introduce the OneUp platform and present our experience of gamifying
a Data Structures course. In the second, workshop attendees engage in hands-on experience:
we show them how to use OneUp in their classes. In particular, we assist them in creating
problems and challenges, configuring desired gamification features, defining their
own badges and rules for earning and spending virtual currency, and monitoring the
engagement and progress of their students. Laptops required.},

them move forward. When we introduced three different reflection scaffolds to support
students, we found that the most effective approach promoted interactive learning

of museums in Cornwall. Focusing upon the Augmented Telegrapher at Porthcurno Telegraph
Museum, a co-designed social escape room experience that utilises the Microsoft HoloLens
to simulate a telegraphy training exercise from World War 2, this article addresses
what partnerships with smaller, rural establishments need to effectively realise the
value of immersive technologies. Using the work of Erik Champion as a critical lens,
the article shows how an iterative constructivist approach leveraging game design
principles can underpin success. This is distilled into a set of recommended interaction
blueprints and transdisciplinary working practices that will be of interest to curators,
researchers, and serious game developers.},

abstract = {Augmented reality games overlay digital artifacts on a camera feed of the environment
to create fantastic experiences in the real world. The act of overlaying digital artifacts
on a real environment requires detailed information about the relative pose of the
player and digital artifacts be accurately sensed and computed, which is often beyond
the capacity of sensor systems deployed on commercial devices such as smartphones.
Game developers are adept at creating compelling experiences from a limited or noisy
palette of interactions, but have limited guidance in the case of augmented reality
games. In this paper, we present a novel technique for evaluating the sensitivity
of augmented reality games and game mechanics to input noise by modifying the sensor
input stream of an open source operating system in a controlled manner. Any game,
commercial or academic, that runs on that operating system can be systematically tested
for the user experience impact of differing levels of sensor input noise. We perform
such an experiment on two commercial and one academic game and determine that similar
levels of input noise have very different impacts on user experience depending on
the game design, input modality, and narrative. The differential impact of noise on
user experience is important because it indicates that proper design decisions can
be used ameliorate or mask sensor noise issues.},

that documented a learning environment intentionally designed to provide urban youth
with tools and learning opportunities that would allow them to create, collaborate

and after-school program was motivated by concern over growing divides with respect
to access to learning environments that can support empowered and generative uses
of technology. Through a unique program that offered both a wide array of special
interest after school clubs (e.g. robotics, graphic design, digital broadcast and
movie making, music recording and remixing, video game development) and mandatory
media arts classes during the school day, learners were able to develop broad and
deep experiences across the middle school years. The program of research involved
an ethnographic study focused on the learning environment, nine case studies of young
producers and their learning ecologies across home, school, and community, and quantitative
tracking of the entire cohort over time. In this session, four papers will be shared
that describe 1) the environment; 2) the theoretical framework guiding the research,
research questions, and associated methods; 3) the development of learners as creative
producers; and 4) the role of artist-mentors as media arts instructors. The contributions
of the symposium include sharing a unique interdisciplinary collaboration and the
results of a unique experiment designed to bridge divides while innovating a new ecological

in a person’s capability or the user interface) and resulting interdependence between
players to create engagement even when one player has no access to a head-mounted
display (HMD). Previous work shows this enhances player experience (PX). Until now,
it remains unclear whether and how an asymmetric game design with interdependences
creates comparably enjoyable PX for both an HMD and a non-HMD player. In this work,
we designed and implemented an asymmetric VR game (different in its user interface)
with two types of interdependence: strategic (difference in game information/player
capability) and biometric (difference in player’s biometric influence). Our mixed-methods
user study (N=30) shows that asymmetries positively impact PX for both player roles,
that interdependence strongly affects players’ perception of agency, and that biometric
feedback—while subjective—is a valuable game mechanic. },

corresponding object to the presented word. We evaluated the effects of Word Saber
on learning efficiency and enjoyment in comparison to a traditional vocabulary learning
method. The results show that Word Saber is effective for vocabulary learning. However,
as Word Saber presented significantly lower scores in terms of recognition and recall
rate compared to a flashcard method, it has lower efficiency. Regarding subjective
preferences, our findings suggest that VR edu-games can be fun and useful for language
learning in the long run as participants reported to be more motivated to use Word
Saber afterward.},

abstract = {In computer science (CS) classes it is common to give students a large ill-defined
problem and let them struggle with it. The mess of the problem forces students to
identify knowledge needed to solve the problem and to learn problem-solving skills.
This is the concept behind problem-based learning (PBL), a learner-centered pedagogy
that has become a popular research topic in computer science. PBL in CS has 3 defining
characteristics: 1) presenting students with large authentic projects, 2) enabling
students to independently learn necessary concepts, and 3) enabling them to learn
while working in groups. An examination of the CS PBL/project-based learning (PrBL)
literature reveals that step 2, self-directed or self-regulated learning (SRL), is
lacking in almost every description of PBL. However, extensive CS research literature
explores effective methods of SRL, and these methods revolve around the concept of
reflection. We therefore propose a new structure for PBL/PrBL that we term messy learning
that explicitly incorporates large, ill-defined, authentic projects and reflective
activities. We also describe our experience with using messy learning in a game development
course and present some examples of how to apply messy learning.},

of the design process, one aspect of which is creating effective level progressions.
A key difficulty is getting the player to practice with interesting combinations of
learned skills while maintaining their engagement. Although recent work in task generation
and sequencing has reduced this effort, we still lack end-to-end automation of the
entire content design process. We approach this goal by incorporating ideas from intelligent
tutoring systems and proposing progression strategies that seek to achieve mastery
of not only base concepts but arbitrary combinations of these concepts. The input
to our system is a model of what the player needs to do to complete each level, expressed
as either an imperative procedure for producing solutions or a representation of features
common to all solutions. The output is a progression of levels that can be adjusted
by changing high-level parameters. We apply our framework to a popular math puzzle
game and present results from 2,377 players showing that our automatic level progression
is comparable to expert-crafted progression after a few design iterations based on
a key engagement metric.},

However, creating motion cycles relies on general-purpose animation packages with

nature, we show that performance animation provides a natural interface for motion
cycle specification. Our system allows the user to act several loops of motion using
a variety of capture devices and automatically extracts a looping cycle from this
potentially noisy input. Motion cycles for different character components can be authored
in a layered fashion, or our method supports cycle extraction from higher-dimensional
data for capture devices that deliver many degrees of freedom. After capture, a custom
curve representation and manipulation tool allows the user to coordinate and control
spatial and temporal transformations from a single viewport. Ground and other planar
contacts are specified with a single sketched line that adjusts a curve's position
and timing to establish non-slipping contact. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
work through tests with both novice and expert users and show a variety of animated
motion cycles created with our system.},

two game design workshops with visually impaired students. The results show that our

them to become creators of movement-based games that are both accessible and engaging.

topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers.
Working groups begin work electronically before the ITiCSE conference. They convene
for face-to-face work on the Friday evening before the conference, work together on
the Saturday and Sunday, and continue working throughout the three days of the conference.
At the end of the conference the groups submit a draft report and a few weeks after
the conference they submit a final report for review.In 2017 16 proposals for Working
Groups were received and a record number of nine Working Groups were selected by the
Working Group chairs to convene at ITiCSE 2017. Participants presented their results
to conference attendees at one of two special working group presentation sessions.
Their final reports were double blind reviewed by at least three selected expert reviewers,
and eight reports were selected for publication in this proceedings for the ACM Digital

assessment development, perceptions of code quality, a holistic understanding through
research papers, effects of lecturer interventions on student behaviour, the Internet

to implement privacy into software systems with the appropriate privacy guidelines

that enables software developers to implement privacy into software systems. Nevertheless,
these guidelines have been developed with lawyers in mind, rather than software developers.
This could hinder developers from putting GDPR into practice and eventually lead to
data breaches through the systems they develop. On the other hand, software developers
also need help (e.g. tooling support or educational interventions). Therefore, this
paper proposes a game design framework, as an educational intervention, to teach software
developers to implement privacy-preserving software systems taking GDPR on-board.
The proposed framework focuses on improving developers’ security coding behavior through
their motivation. It also ensures software developers can put GDPR into practice when

transgressive game design, building on Aarseth's [1] framework of transgressive play.
To substantiate our argument, we use an examination of recent queer visual novels

about their plans while simultaneously managing their own gaze to avoid giving away
their plans. This socially competitive dimension is lacking in most online games,
where players are out of sight of each other. We conducted a lab study using a strategic
online game; finding that (1) players are better at discerning their opponent's plans
when shown a live visualisation of the opponent's gaze, and (2) players who are aware
that their gaze is tracked will manipulate their gaze to keep their intentions hidden.
We describe the strategies that players employed, to various degrees of success, to
deceive their opponent through their gaze behaviour. This gaze-based deception adds
an effortful and challenging aspect to the competition. Lastly, we discuss the various
implications of our findings and its applicability for future game design.},

programs, we need to change the way we deliver first-year computer programming curricula.
Introductory courses have the potential to attract and to retain students. This session
will describe the use of Problem Based Learning (PBL) and game design in an introduction
to programming course. The course is divided into three parts with approximately five
weeks each: (1) introduction to Programming, (2) introduction to Object-Oriented programming
and Graphical Unit Interface (GUI) programming, and (3) the final project, which includes
the design and implementation of a computer game. The computer language used in the
course is JAVA. The course is designed with Problem Base Learning to incentive students'
creativity and learning. The course provides the students with opportunities to engage
in problem solving, team discussions, collaborative work, and critical thinking. In
addition, the students are challenged to identify and find solutions to their programming
problems. This approach should help to prepare students to enter in a field that is
rapidly changing, and where they will be required to constantly learn new things and
to take initiative. The session will present some samples of class assignments and
final projects as well as a summary of the survey conducted with students enrolled
in the course.},

psychology, computer graphics, as well as researchers from other disciplines working
on new interactive entertainment specific technologies or providing critical analysis
of games and interactive environments.IE2012's overarching theme is Playing the System.
This notion invites a counter-cultural perspective, offering the possibility of change
by doing things differently, using systems in unforeseen ways, fighting with the computer
or simply tinkering around with existing protocols. At this conference we recognize
that play is valuable in itself, allowing users who playfully interact with their
computers to create new realities, to become players and artists. They are not asking
for permission, reading the manual or following orders. They are playing the system.This
year, IE2012 presents a collection of cutting-edge research papers, demos and exhibits
in multi-disciplinary areas of play, which includes artificial intelligence, game
design and serious game case studies. All accepted papers have undergone a rigorous
double-blind peer review process with at least 3 reviewers each from the IE2012 Program
Committee. Authors were then invited to submit either full papers or extended abstracts
for further review, according to the conference criteria.},

abstract = {In fighting games, players can perform many different actions at each instant of time,
leading to an exponential number of possible sequences of actions. Some of these combinations
can lead to unexpected behaviors, which can compromise the game design. One example
of these unexpected behaviors is the occurrence of long or infinite combos, a long
sequence of actions that does not allow any reactions from the opponent. Finding these
sequences is essential to ensure fairness in fighting games, but evaluating all possible
sequences is a time consuming task. In this paper, we propose the use of an evolutionary
algorithm to find combos on a fighting game. The main idea is to use a genetic algorithm
to evolve a population composed of sequences of inputs and, using an adequate fitness
function, select the ones that are more suitable to be considered combos. We performed
a series of experiments and the results show that the proposed approach was not only
successful in finding combos, managing to find unexpected sequences, but also superior
to previous methods.},

results suggest that NPCs displaying lower levels of assertiveness evoke more positive
emotional responses but are not more effective at influencing players' decisions when
compared to NPCs displaying higher levels of this trait. However, NPCs displaying
a personality trait are more effective persuaders than NPCs not displaying this feature.
Overall, this paper highlights the importance of considering the player's personality

Arcade (Arcade), which is suited for K-12, outreach, and CS1. Hands-on activities
will provide context for interesting computing ideas, like event driven programming,
the concept of state, and principles of Human-Computer Interaction. We will start
with a novice-friendly, block-based programming paradigm (similar to Scratch), but
also show how Arcade's environment naturally scaffolds students into text-based languages
as we progress to examples in JavaScript and Python (prior experience not needed).
Other introductory tools often have shortcomings for games: a) game elements, like
scoring and multiplayer capabilities, can be challenging to implement and b) finished
games lack features associated with "real" games, like gamepad controls. This workshop
will showcase Arcade features uniquely suited for games, such as scoring primitives
and sprite data types, and how games can be deployed to low-cost consoles, comparable
to Nintendo's Gameboy. Participants will: 1) complete example games using game elements,
2) see Arcade's use in remote education, 3) gain insight into succinct, meaningful
activities for a variety of audiences (K-12, outreach, CS1), and 4) get educators'
perspectives on the pros/cons of the Arcade platform. Activities will be completed
via web browsers (Chrome preferred). Deployment to hardware will be demonstrated and
participants can follow along if they own hardware, but it isn't required (to acquire
hardware see the 'Hardware' section of https://arcade.makecode.com/).},

abstract = {Successfully predicting visual attention can significantly improve many aspects of
computer graphics: scene design, interactivity and rendering. Most previous attention
models are mainly based on low-level image features, and fail to take into account
high-level factors such as scene context, topology, or task. Low-level saliency has
previously been combined with task maps, but only for predetermined tasks. Thus, the
application of these methods to graphics (e.g., for selective rendering) has not achieved
its full potential. In this article, we present the first automated high-level saliency
predictor incorporating two hypotheses from perception and cognitive science that
can be adapted to different tasks. The first states that a scene is comprised of objects
expected to be found in a specific context as well objects out of context which are
salient (scene schemata) while the other claims that viewer’s attention is captured
by isolated objects (singletons). We propose a new model of attention by extending
Eckstein’s Differential Weighting Model. We conducted a formal eye-tracking experiment
which confirmed that object saliency guides attention to specific objects in a game
scene and determined appropriate parameters for a model. We present a GPU-based system
architecture that estimates the probabilities of objects to be attended in real- time.
We embedded this tool in a game level editor to automatically adjust game level difficulty
based on object saliency, offering a novel way to facilitate game design. We perform
a study confirming that game level completion time depends on object topology as predicted
by our system.},

abstract = {This learning workshop will prototype and advance theory around the participatory
design of hybrid games. In contrast to screen-centered games, our platform makes it
easier to repurpose ordinary urban objects -- from aging payphones to experimental
bus stop displays. The resulting games are hybrids, where the action is alternately
woven across the digital and physical.Successful hybrid games offer choices to players
that are immediate, from introducing neighbors (building the social fabric), to photographing
street art (documenting local culture), buying from a local business (shifting the
economy), and revealing local history.Based on three years of experience in South
Los Angeles, our methods for Participatory Design (PD) combine low and high-tech to
leverage local culture. The resulting games emphasize social mixing -- including with
local businesses -- and are amplified online with flows of pictures, audio and text.For
workshop participants, no technology skills are needed --since the platform seeks
to maximize participation in the design process. Participants' own knowledge of cities
and important cultural neighborhoods will be used to create 2-3 semifunctional games.
Hidden in each design is a set of technologies that join communication networks, including
cell phone SMS and Raspberry Pi computers hidden inside payphones.The most important
result of this workshop may be in identifying PD theory that could help the field
of game design, and vice-versa, as the two fields increasingly consider street-based
media and how to constitute publics around city streets.},

with relatively high production demands of the user: a weaver must be physically engaged
with the system to enact a pattern, line by line, into a fabric. Rather than approaching
co-presence and repetitive labor as a negative aspect of design, we look to current
practices in procedural generation (most commonly used in game design and screen-based
new media art) to understand how designers can create room for suprise and emergent
phenomena within systems of precision and constraint. We developed three designs for
blending real-time input with predetermined pattern features. These include: using
camera imagery sampled at weaving time; a 1:1 scale tool for composing patterns on
the loom; and a live "Twitch'' stream where spectators determine the woven pattern.
We discuss how experiential qualities of the systems led to different balances of
underdetermination in procedural generation as well as how such an approach might
help us think beyond an artifact/experience dichotomy in fabrication.},

of the software architectures of game-development environments such as Unity and Unreal,
which are used extensively in developing 3D user interfaces. In these systems, UI
components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific
callback functions. In some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is
used to propagate events among vertically connected components. When components need
to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and
register/unregister events as needed. Moreover, events and callback signatures may
be incompatible, making modular UIs cumbersome to build and share within or across
applications. To address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, Mercury,
to facilitate communication among components. We provide an overview of Mercury, outline
its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes,
describe a reference implementation in Unity, and present example systems built using
Mercury to explain its advantages.},

that are often explained by way of the knowledge, attitudes, and general practices
that they entail. However, to become facile with CT, learners require instruction
that is grounded in concrete, relevant experiences. This paper examines teacher practices
that are intended to promote CT skill acquisition through instruction that takes place
in two framing contexts. The phenomenological context, which is based on observable
patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly
valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to
recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning
to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within
and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency
with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable
Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers
both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.},

and IDE for introducing students to programming in an approachable way that appeals
to students interests and cultural experiences. GameMaker allows students to create
and program playable games using the introductory development GUI, and then seamlessly
transition to programming using the GameMaker Language (GML). While the idea of introducing
software development through game design or other interesting and engaging approaches
is not new, many innovative approaches do not seamlessly progress into programming.
Students must often discard the platform-specific techniques and skills when moving
to a traditional programming language, leveraging only conceptual understanding. This
is particularly true when transitioning from an icon-based drag-and-drop GUI development
system that supports the logic of programming while insulating the student developer
from syntax and language complexity. Because the GML follows Java syntax and supports
OO concepts, the transition from GML to Java programming is a natural progression.
This paper demonstrates that GameMaker GML follows Java syntax and supports OO technologies
and concepts including objects, methods, and inheritance along with standard program
control features (various loops and ifs), along with discrete real-time control and
timing, graphical objects and design.},

abstract = {The activity of play has transformative power. When a design invites play, it encourages
co-creation and empowers participants to take control over their own experience. Yet,
just as game design strives to create challenges that are fun to overcome, play design
also strives to create specific, unique experiences - and those experiences will only
be available if players to a certain extent succumb to the intentions of designers.
Finding the balance between player and designer initiative is thus not straightforward.
In this presentation I will discuss example designs that have managed - and some that
haven't - eliciting some of the design strategies that can be brought to aid. I will
also pose the critical question: does this transformative power reach out of play?
Are the powers of play revolutionary - or not?},

behavior for non-human characters has received less attention. However, virtual behavior
not only affects game design, but also allows creating authentic avatars or robotic
companions.After a discussion of methods to model and recognize emotions, we present
three characters with a decreasing level of human features and describe how established
design techniques can be adapted for such characters.In a study, 220 participants
assess these characters' emotional behavior, focusing on the emotion "anger". We want
to determine how reliable users can recognize emotional behavior, if characters increasingly
do not look and behave like humans. A secondary aim is determining if gender has an
impact on the competence in emotion recognition.The findings indicate that there is
an area of insecure attribution of virtual affective behavior not distant but close
to human behavior. We also found that at least for anger, men and women assess emotional
behavior equally well.},

abstract = {The computing and STEM industries face challenges in attracting people to fill expanding
needs. The literature shows that computing preconceptions shape interest in and impact
decisions of whether or not to enter computing disciplines, especially for women and
underrepresented minorities. In this study, our research questions focused on how
perceptions of programming in elementary and middle school students varied based on
prior programming experience. We examined the programming constructs they found challenging.
Our study was in the context of a week-long summer camp dedicated to Scratch-based
game development. We conducted semi-structured interviews at the beginning, middle,
and end of the weeklong program with 28 students who agreed to participate. During
the interviews, we asked students about their perceptions of programming in general
and which programming constructs they found easy and/or hard. We found that all students
perceived programming as a means of creating artifacts, but that students with prior
programming experience went deeper by associating programming with process and function.
We also characterize the specific Scratch programming constructs that beginning versus
experienced children perceive as easy and/or hard. These findings will help experts
and educators better understand how children think about programming and how experience
changes these perceptions over time. These findings also have implications on the
design of curricula and instructional resources to address difficulties children face
while learning to program.},

year = {2018},

address = {USA},
abstract = {At McMaster University, we have developed a framework for teaching computer science,
including curricula and tools (iPad apps: Image 2 Bits and ElmJr; an open-source library
GraphicSVG; and a web-based development environment). ElmJr is a projectional editor
for Elm, with knowledge of our graphics library. Using ElmJr, children transform programs
through contextual menus. As a result, they never see syntax or type errors. Children
as young as 10 years old, who have just started learning about syntax in English,
can be productive programmers. We will explain how ElmJr is designed to make programming
simple for beginners, and how strong typing in Elm and our graphics library is key
to making the list of program transformations manageable. We will explain the design
and findings of a study of children in 14 classes (grade 4 and 5) in the Hamilton-Wentworth
District School Board, who received 12 hours of instruction over eight weeks in ElmJr
with the aim of improving their mathematics knowledge. In parallel, another eight
grade 6 to 8 classes received at least two hours of instruction in Elm using our web-IDE,
culminating in a Wordathon. The Wordathon is designed to reconcile the power of social
computing with the need to protect children's privacy. The intermediate classes were
challenged to create animations in Elm of assigned words identified by teachers as
K-4 core reading vocabulary. Joining the intermediate students in this activity, two
high school classes were taught how to create interactive applications in Elm and
were challenged to create a reading game using the word animations created by the
intermediate children. In all, four games incorporating 408 animations were created,
and some of the intermediate students presented the games to primary grades in their
schools. Unlike typical network effects, we get a multiplier effect: more word animations
make game development more attractive, and more games make animations more attractive.
Having a critical mass then attracts the attention of other educators, including in
this case the team implementing the board-wide reading strategy. All of this can be
accomplished without any identifying information leaving the classroom.},

and encounter in post-conflict environments. It reports on ethnographic fieldwork
from the Nairobi Play Project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents
aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in Kenya. While the
program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster
interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds.
Based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24
students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to
be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs.
We argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through
moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that
produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing
activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively
fill in. We also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures
to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances
of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. We reflect on the
implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing
as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in CSCW,
ICTD, and allied fields of work.},

itself has a rich history going back at least 3,000 years, and among other things
boasts a well-preserved historical town center, many porticoes and towers. The city
is ranked at the top on the list of Italian cities in terms of quality of life and
quality of food.The conference continues to be a truly international conference with
241 submissions with a total of 554 authors from 40 countries on all continents: the
authors came from Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North
America including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and South
America (50). In total, a total of 175 papers, one panel, and 16 working groups were
submitted. Additionally, there were 31 posters and 18 tips &amp; techniques submissions.All
research papers were double blind reviewed by at least six reviewers. This year, 56
papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. All
posters and tips &amp; techniques submissions were also reviewed by two reviewers. 24
posters and nine Tips and Techniques submissions were accepted.The nine accepted working
groups will address a diverse section of topics, including student engagement, game
development, integrating international students, assessment development, code quality
perceptions, a holistic understanding through research papers, effects of lecturer
intervention on student behaviour, the Internet of Things and early developmental
activities leading to computational thinking skills. Participating in a working group
is probably one of the most efficient ways to become part of the ITiCSE community.
It provides participants a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries
who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group.This conference
will have two keynote speakers. Stefano Zacchiroli from the University of Paris, Diderot
will present the Software Heritage project; its goals, challenges, and potential scholarly
and educational uses. Sana Odeh will discuss her work in broadening participation
in computer science in the Arab world. In particular, Dr. Odeh will present the achievements
of her annual Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab world.In addition to the tradition
conference banquet, which will be held at a traditional Italian trattoria, conference
delegates will have the opportunity to explore Bologna's sights, smells, and tastes.We
hope you will be intellectually challenged, gastronomically sated, and culturally
fulfilled. Furthermore, our most fervent hope is that you will return home with new
ideas to try in your classroom, and new friends and colleagues with whom you can collaborate.},

abstract = {Welcome to PCGames 2011, the Second International Workshop on Procedural Content Generation
in Games, held June 28, 2011 and co-located with the 2011 Foundations of Digital Games
conference.Procedural content generation (PCG), where a computer algorithm produces
computationally generated levels, art assets, quests, background history, stories,
characters, and weapons, offers hope for substantially reducing the authoring burden
in games. There are also many potential benefits to PCG, beyond reducing authoring
costs. The generation algorithm itself acts as an executable model of the generated
aspect of the game, thereby improving our theoretical understanding of game design.
With rich procedural generation, a single person becomes capable of creating games
that once required entire teams to create, thus making individual artistic expression
easier to achieve. Automated content generation can take player history as an input,
and thereby create games that adapt to individual players. PCG has the potential to
enable entirely new kinds of games and playable experiences that have previously been
impossible to create due to human authoring limitations.This workshop has 5 full papers
and 4 short papers discussing different aspects of PCG, from questioning the nature
of PCG itself to specific content generation techniques. Papers will be presented
at the workshop and appear in these proceedings. Each paper received three reviews
and the final acceptance decisions were ratified by Gillian Smith, who acted in the
role of Program Chair. The overall acceptance rate was 90%.The primary goal of this
workshop is to foster discussion on all aspects of procedural content generation,
and strengthen the community of procedural content generation researchers. Please
enjoy the workshop, and we look forward to a number of engaging discussions!},

a novel paradigm for participatory design of 3D virtual scenes on mobile devices.
Designers and users are actively engaged in the design process so as to ensure that
the results meet their needs with high standards of usability. Our new system allows
the designers to construct an initial virtual scene via two tablet devices, one of
which supports the scene assembly in a 2D window, while the other displays the corresponding
3D scene synchronously. Subsequently, the designers adapt the 3D scene based on real-time
feedback of users exploring the virtual scene via a VR device, consisting of a smartphone
with cardboard 3D glasses. The participants can then discuss how to further fine-tune
the virtual scene by replaying the recorded footage of the user's experience process,
interacting on their own respective tablets or smartphones. The system has been applied
to the design of VR environments for virtual museums, residential decoration, firefighter
training, and 3D games. Our user study suggests that this system not only increases
the efficiency of the design process, but also gives rise to better designs.},

abstract = {We focus on the dining and show how to improve dining experience. We use sound effects
to augment food texture, creating a cross-modal illusion.Our system is composed of
a bone-conduction speaker, a microphone, a photoreflector to measure the motion of
jaw, and a computer to design the sound effect or filtering.We focus on the texture
of food, an important component of deliciousness, to enhance the eating experience
without modifying the physical or chemical feature of the food. We use prevailing
technologies to detect chewing action, feedback and process the chewing sound. In
addition, we design some chewing augmentation filter for each foods. These combinations
create the cross-modality effect for food texture.We have developed three elements.
First is a bite-detection sensor, utilizing a photoreflector, to measure the movement
of the lower jaw. Second is a sound filter for each type of food that will be used
to control food texture. Third is a self-feedback system to enhance the chewing action
that records the chewing sound and the jaw motion, and delivers it to the user using
bone-conduction speakers.Our aim is to redesign the experience of eating. We believe
this technology is useful for following situations. For a start, it is a challenge
to improve the eating QoL for dentures users. As they cannot bite strongly, they get
a reduced sensation of food. Chewing Jockey helps to restore that sensation. Another
application is to moderate the chewing speed. Chewing too fast is not good for digestion
and also leads to over-eating. With our technology, we can provide the most suitable
chewing speed to alter such habits. Lastly, chewing can be a form of interaction for
a novel game design, in which you could role-play a monster chewing on "living" things.},

of game production by providing common technologies and convenient content-creation
tools. Game engine based development is therefore the mainstream methodology in the
game industry.Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is an emerging game development
methodology, which applies the Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) method in
the game development domain. This simplifies game development by reducing the gap
between game design and implementation. MDGD has to take advantage of the existing
game engines in order to be useful in commercial game development practice. However,
none of the existing MDGD approaches in literature has convincingly demonstrated good
integration of its tools with the game engine tool-chain. In this paper, we propose
a hybrid approach named ECGM to address the integration challenges of two methodologies
with a focus on the technical aspects. The approach makes a run-time engine the base
of the domain framework, and uses the game engine tool-chain together with the MDGD
tool-chain. ECGM minimizes the change to the existing workflow and technology, thus
reducing the cost and risk of adopting MDGD in commercial game development. Our contribution
is one important step towards MDGD industrialization.},

a game, and along the way learn about many common challenges in modern SE practice
through personal discovery and experience. The game itself also imposes challenges
in that we have chosen a new, unfamiliar game genre and domain that emphasizes science
learning as its purpose for play. Along the way, we discuss issues in requirements,
design, prototyping, testing, user experience assessment, and evolutionary software
extension, all prior to a formal education in coding or introductory level Computer
Science or SE. Though our efforts may seem unusual or anomalous, we believe our methods
are open for adoption and reuse by those interested in lowering the barriers to entry
into game software development in specific, and into SE more generally.},

software engineering process models and methods. However, in order to be effective,
this approach should be properly aligned to the learning outcomes. Common misalignments
are caused by using a correct degree of realism or an appropriate instruction level.Objective:
To foster students to acquire knowledge (theoretical and practical) that enables them
solving similar challenges to the ones they will face in real-world software projects.Methods:
We prototype and validate a legacy game that simulates the software development process.
Students are required to plan and manage a software project according to its specification
provided by the teachers. Teachers act as both customers and moderators, presenting
the challenges and guiding the students' teamwork.Results: Both students' and teachers'
perception suggest that the proposed game has potential to motivate the knowledge
acquisition through problem-solving. The feedback also suggests that some measures
must be taken to ensure the pedagogical alignment and a fair game.Conclusion: The
lessons learned provide suggestions for adopting this or similar games in the context
of project courses. As further work, we plan to describe and extend the game rules
based on the results of this application.},

studios universally state and perceive that they use the agile framework Scrum and
sometimes Kanban, their actual practices often differ from these frameworks in key
areas. Furthermore, studios collectively overestimated their level of adherence with
Scrum. This has general implications for related academic studies as well as for the

abstract = {This poster presents our experience in using a Game Development Engine (GDE, i.e.
Unity) for teaching introductory Computer Graphics (CG) courses. About a decade ago,
standard textbooks used in CG courses began updating to adopt shader-based APIs and
programmable GPUs. More recently, Graphics APIs evolved towards a lower level of hardware
abstraction, reduced overhead, and multithreading capabilities. Once again, CG instructors
have to either use outdated models, or change the way they teach. Acknowledging the
divide between the development speed of GDEs, and the complexity and vastness of new
graphics APIs, we show how the use of a GDE can help students understand core CG concepts,
and still include shader-based programming, while low-level tasks are managed by the
engine itself.},

abstract = {This paper reports on an intervention in introductory Computer Graphics courses, where
practical coursework is transitioned from standard OpenGL Graphics APIs to the Unity
Game Development Engine. Game Development Engines (GDEs) provide powerful programming
tools and computing components. Software development in GDEs is facilitated by full-fledged
IDEs. Complex scene modeling and image rendering are managed through a rich catalogue
of rendering assets. Graphics APIs are evolving towards a lower level of hardware
abstraction, reduced overhead, and multithreading capabilities. Such changes in APIs
benefit software developers who build graphics engines; how much they benefit Computer
Graphics education is yet to be determined. New graphics APIs represent a shift in
graphics programming practices, nearly as big as programmable GPUs and shader-based
APIs over a decade ago. As then, Computer Graphics instructors have to decide: either
use outdated models, or again change how Computer Graphics is taught. This paper describes
an educational approach that acknowledges the increasing divide between the ease of
use and development speed of GDEs, and the complexity and vastness of new graphics
APIs. We show the use of a GDE as software development framework, to support programming
assignments covering core Computer Graphics concepts. Relying on a GDE, such graphics
assignments don't have to shy away from shader-based graphics programming, while non-graphics
low-level tasks are managed by the engine itself. With our approach, we hope to contribute
to the discussion about evolving best practices in teaching Computer Graphics.},

iteration, in order to plan the design of the next iteration. However, it can be challenging
to devise a simple approach to acquiring information about a player's engagement while
playing. In this paper we will thus use an evaluation method which focuses on assessing
the desire to continue playing as an indicator of player engagement. This feedback
can then be applied to detect and prevent any design decisions that would jeopardise
a game's level of player engagement. The process is exemplified by a case study concerning
a crowd game which is controlled by smartphones and is intended to be played by audiences
in cinemas and at venues with large screens. The case study demonstrates how the approach
can be used to help improve the desire to continue when developing a game.},

have the chance to meet and collaborate to create prototypes of games together, whether
digital or analog. In this explorative study, data from the GGJ website across four
years of game jams and their participants are analyzed, towards investigating group
interaction and group forming behavior. The focus is on using social network analysis
and social metrics to evaluate the influence of a) jammer skillset and b) jam locations,
on social and communicative structures among game jammers in the GGJ environment.
The findings suggest that different skill-sets support different forms of social structures

abstract = { Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software
engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video
game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest.
In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents.
The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other
software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary
to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints.
Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these
tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers.
These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research,
industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development,
researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests
that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment. },

The game design component was focused on life cycle analysis (LCA) including environmental
impacts of engineering design. Observations and artifacts were collected from workshops
and interviews were conducted. Results showed that students had a general awareness
about environmental issues but lacked awareness about LCA, pollution, and wetlands.
Additionally, the participatory game design process showed that students struggled
with applying the newly gained understandings of LCA in the game designs. The participatory

abstract = {The importance of capstone senior design project courses is widely recognized for
undergraduate software engineering curricula. They provide students with an opportunity
to integrate and apply theoretical knowledge (both from previous courses and newly
acquired for the project) on a team, improving both their technical and soft-skills.
Here, we report our experiences using an agile development method for a game project;
this is a radical shift from our previous course offerings that were based on waterfall,
model driven development. This report is unique and valuable, especially for software
engineering education, which goes beyond the discipline-specific limits of computer
science curricula.},

abstract = {Context. Over the last several decades, computer games started to have a significant
impact on society. However, although a computer game is a type of software, the process
to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual features. In software
testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance of professionals to use
automated testing techniques with games, due to the constant changes in requirements
and design, and pointed out the need for creating testing tools that take into account
the flexibility required for the game development process. Goal. This study aims to
improve the current body of knowledge regarding these theme and point out the existing
particularities observed in software testing considering the development of a computer
game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case study and a survey was applied
to collect quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners regarding the particularities
of software testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted
on three well-established network of question-and-answer communities and received
answers of 38 practitioners, and identified important aspects to be observed in the
process of planning, performing and reporting tests games. Conclusion. Considering
computer games, software testing must focus not only on the common aspects of a general
software, but also, track and investigate issues that could be related to game balance,
game physics and entertainment related-aspects to guarantee the quality of computer
games and a successful testing process.},

abstract = {Recent years have borne witness to an explosion of games research from diverse home
disciplines. Much of this work concerns game design, but the games research community
has yet to agree on practices and methods for examining game design that are simultaneously
rigorously scholarly, flexible enough to accommodate a design-oriented perspective,
and sufficiently knowledgeable of computation to engage with the materiality of games.In
this paper, we outline such an approach. We focus on the question of an appropriate
method for an academic game design research practice that is grounded in making and
play while respecting recoverability and context. We demonstrate what game analysis
based on such a method can reveal, drawing on the case of Pippin Barr's It is as if
you were doing work, and show how method and analysis in tandem can materialise tacit
design knowledge, support balanced subjectivity, and illuminate the often abstract
design problem space.},

design practice where a developer publicly releases an incomplete game and iterate
on it while gathering feedback from the player community. It argues that open development
is fundamentally a communication and user experience practice characterized by a commitment
to access, transparency, and feedback. Ultimately, it shows open development as a
practice where game developers are consciously designing a compelling experience of

game called Co-smonauts. The main aim of the research project was to identify design
factors for intergenerational games in a museum context that foster the social exchange
between old and young, feature an intuitive control scheme, and offer a certain amount
of depth that keeps players enjoying themselves. In detail, this submission provides
an overview of the study-guided design process and key design decisions that led to
the final game. Three steps are presented (Game Design, Building Phase Design, Navigator
Interface Design), each of them containing a detailed description of the design challenges,
the carried out studies to face the challenges, and the design implications. In general,
we aim at providing insights for both researchers and designers regarding the design,
the development, and the evaluation of co-located collaborative intergenerational
games.},
