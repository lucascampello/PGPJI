abstract={The Game Design Document (GDD) plays a key role in the design phase of every game development. A poorly elaborated GDD can lead to rework and loss of investment in production and postproduction phases. To address these issues, an analysis of several available GDDs found in the literature was performed, contrasting our findings with the best practices from Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Our improved GDD incorporates a common understanding of terms, quality assurance, decision making, definition of relations, boundaries, limitations and knowledge of game elements. Finally, our GDD is put side by side with a commercial GDD.},

abstract={People have become addicted to their electronic devices spending more time playing video games. This addiction could be due to the attractive and rapid development in technology of devices. Additionally, home quarantine precaution imposed by the COVID 19 pandemic increased one's connection to electronic devices. These reasons and much more affected the educational methodology landscape. On the other hand, old teaching techniques especially in the engineering education nowadays are not fulfilling the market needs [1], [2]. Engineers are required to be up to date as market requirements changes [3]. More practical teaching methods are expected to prepare fresh graduate engineers to the market [1]. These practical skills should be developed in safe environments with an economic, and more engaging ways to engineering students. With the help of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, this goal could be achieved [4]. This research aims to develop a VR game that meets these needs. This work focuses on understanding the system requirements of the VR game for engineering education using engineering ethics as a case study. Requirements investigation, understanding, and documentation are done using Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools. As a result, the system's requirements are identified with seven logical models and an initial physical model. Consequently, three entities are identified for this VR game: learners, instructor and advisor. Entities relationships also have been demarcated. Future work includes the models' validation, game prototyping, and implementation using learners and educators' feedbacks on the proposed VR game.},

To up keeping the industry of games development, much unique original equipment manufacturer (OEM) openly distribute their software development kit (SDK) and application programming interface (API) to inspire individuals to develop "indie developer". The game is a kind of software with the goal to provide entertainment. However, during the real game development practice, simply adopting the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is not enough, as the developers face several challenges during its life cycle. To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development. However, none of the existing DLC clearly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game. This research presents a hybrid game development model and guidelines to successfully deliver a good quality game. Several quality standards as are clearly considered at each phase (Jain, S (2017)).},

The course fuses computing and engineering using game design and robotics as an offering for both cohorts of students to work together in a multidisciplinary environment. Over the course of the semester, students learn introductory computing and engineering design concepts by designing games and robots using informatics tools to solve design challenges. Interdisciplinary teams consisting of computing and engineering students work together to prototype a game design idea and then bring that idea to life using robots as part of their final project.},

abstract={In these times of great changes, managing software projects effectively is a big challenge and it is increasingly more difficult to find skilled professionals. This paper presents the Project Management Game 2D (PMG-2D), an educational serious game that aims to assist inexperienced software project managers to be trained, considering cost, time, risk and human resources management areas. The PMG-2D simulates a real software development environment where the player, acting as a project manager, goes through all basic phases of a software project lifecycle. There are many roles in the team that have to be managed, and the members have different personalities in order to challenge the player when dealing with people and their conflicts and performance, among other characteristics. The mechanism implemented to control the character's personalities is based on the theory of the Five Big Factors, described by the lexical method conceived in the Psychology area. The evaluation was conducted within the context of a software engineering continuing education course, and 25 participants have played the game and answered a questionnaire. When analyzing the results, it was possible to find evidence that the game, besides assisting the project management training, stimulates the player to learn more about it.},

abstract={Educators need to know how to motivate information-management (IM) students (i.e., future business practitioners) to learn and use project management, which can provide the practical skills necessary for IM professionals to analyze data and make decisions. This case designed a platform of game-based learning for IM students' studying based on course of project management. Using a sample of 54 sophomores in Taiwan, a modified TAM model, self-efficacy and flow experience in playfulness were examined using experimental design and causal analysis for learner's attitude and behavior. A knowledge test is conducted to inspect the learning performance with platform support. Test results present higher performance in posttest than in pretest. The empirical results show that self-efficacy has significant, positive effects on perceived usefulness; but not significance on perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use is positive influence on perceived usefulness on flow experience. In addition, it was found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, positively influence IM students' attitude to use game-based learning platform, and flow experience not significantly effect on attitude to use game-based learning platform, whereas attitude toward game-based learning platform has a significant, positive impact on behavioral intentions, and the behavioral intentions has positively significant impact on actual platform use based on course of project management. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this paper.},

abstract={Mobile games are relatively new industry, and their relevance on the game markets are rising. At the same time, it is very competitive market, as new games are coming out by hundreds every day. The challenges for the new game development come from the creative process and the human factors on how to make the game appealing. In this research, we study the use of test groups as part of new mobile game and concept development process in the early phases. They were used to complement the testing automation at the development phases when use of analytics was not yet possible. Six separate feedback collection sessions were arranged using different methods. The paper presents the main learnings of each used method, the perceived usefulness of the methods for the entire development process. We also contribute to the growing knowledge for mobile game development, focusing on methods for the testing with test user approaches. We conclude that testing with user groups can help clarify the mobile game design to create a more appealing game, but choosing the right groups and right moments in the game development phase can be difficult, as can be the interpretation of the feedback for decision making.},

Internal issues referring to the constraints of some national education standards among which the standard process, teachers and education personnel standards, and competency standards. The standard process has a problem that improvement mindset has not done well in the learning process of the learning method centered on the teacher (teacher centered) into a student-centered teaching methods (student oriented)[17]. Standard teachers and education personnel have a problem of low professionalism of teachers in Indonesia proved in 2010 the number of teachers who meet the qualification standards nationally only 43%[2]-Standardized competence of graduates have problems one of which is evidenced by the results of the 2012 survey data by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which mentions the mathematical ability of students in Indonesia was ranked 64 out of 65 countries[1]. In addition to internal problems are also external problems in the organization of education as the result of research that says that as many as 600 students in grade eight and nine on average spend 9 hours per week playing games keseluruhan. Playing games have proven to deliver negative correlation with academic achievement of students, if played in a long period of time[5]. In this digital era, it is appropriate that educational games have a more comprehensive capabilities for responding the internal and external challenges of the world of education.

abstract={This paper presents findings of a field study into the design and initial evaluation of a role-playing game based on a model of a complex tendering process at a German manufacturing company. Conceived as part of an inhouse training for 1,000 employees by the process management unit, the role-playing game aims to familiarize the participants with the intricacies of the manufacturer's tendering process - by instructing them to properly interpret a BPMN (Business Process Model & Notation) representation of the process presented to the participants in a modelling tool. Rather than presenting the participants with a syntactically correct and semantically adequate process model, the process model is reduced to a simplified representation of the control flow and to placeholders for activities, events, roles, documents and information systems. In the role-playing game, teams of four employees from different business functions perform the group task of understanding the meaning of predefined model elements in the context of the tendering process, and of assigning these elements to the correct placeholder under time pressure and in competition with other teams in the room. As an original game element, video interviews with experts on a particular aspect of the tendering process are attached to the respective model elements and are required by the participants to solve the group task. The game design is tested and developed in three pilot trainings. We report on the design of the role-playing game, its initial evaluation, and conclude with a discussion of our findings.},

One such technique is the use of serious games, but the design of such games tends to be complex, currently lacking a map of game design standards that comply with the Software Engineering education requirements. This paper presents the process to identify the game design patterns that can be effective for teaching software engineering, specifically the software project management topic. The process begins by identifying the relationship between game design patterns and teaching and learning functions based on literature review. Then the work follows establishing a relationship between teaching and learning functions and software project management education through questionnaires made to software engineering teachers. Finally, it sets up the relationship between game design patterns and software project management education through an empirical study conducted with master students. These results can be used as a basis for designing and developing serious games for teaching software project management.},

The goal is to be descriptive and informing through a qualitative rendering, rather than prescriptive and quantitative analysis. This study draws attention to the case of where a student with no prior experience in software development or programming must take on the task of learning how to make a game, and along the way learn about many common challenges in modern SE practice through personal discovery and experience. The game itself also imposes challenges in that we have chosen a new, unfamiliar game genre and domain that emphasizes science learning as its purpose for play. Along the way, we discuss issues in requirements, design, prototyping, testing, user experience assessment, and evolutionary software extension, all prior to a formal education in coding or introductory level Computer Science or SE. Though our efforts may seem unusual or anomalous, we believe our methods are open for adoption and reuse by those interested in lowering the barriers to entry into game software development in specific, and into SE more generally.},

abstract={Agile operations management can potentially improve performance output and quality of workers through the use of gamification in non-work environments. The paper investigates the potential application of gamification in work environments using concurrent engineering strategies to drive performance orientation and user engagement. A game model was developed by the Mechatronics and Robotics Research Group at the University of KwaZulu-Natal to implement gamification in research management and optimize research output. The game was devised from hexa-block game mechanics and employed interactive strategies to engage the user's in the performance of required research objectives. The experimental development described the phases of game design and adaption according to unbalanced game mechanics and additional game features. Results were attained from work output performance and trends were evaluated between work performance with and without gamification.},

abstract={The mobile Internet business is entering a new era in Japan with the emerging revenue being generated from mobile social games. Users using high-speed mobile Internet with flat-rate data services have acceptance of micro-payments and increased payment acceptance in mobile social games. This has been impacting mobile business and the game business in Japan for the last 12 months. Given the hype surrounding mobile social games, the author attempts to identify the guidelines in game design that were not explored in traditional game design. Time-factor is one of the to-be-explored factors in the human factors. It provides a rich source of industrial applications including social games in the anyplace and anytime context. The author highlights the time-dimensional factors in this emerging design methodology for mobile social games.},

abstract={Learning object oriented programming (OOP) is a hard task for many beginning students who have already familiar with procedural language paradigm. Over the last six semesters, only about 59.27% students who take OOP class passed. To address persistent difficulties mainly imposed by the already known paradigm, we adopted the approach of cooperative learning based on game design with visual programming environment to teach OOP. Using the context of game design, we identify the concept of object to assist students with understanding object oriented design principles. In this research, we use GameMaker to teach about object concept by creating a game and MinimUML to teach about class design before implementing any code. As the implementation of cooperative learning, the class is divided as some groups. This method is implemented in second semester of year 2008/2009 in five classes and about 124 students have taken this course. This method can improve the student passing grades from 59.27% in the previous semesters become 80.64%.},

abstract={Software development faces challenges from high expectation of software qualities, complexity of software and long development cycle. While Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) is helping developers overcome many of these challenges in many domains, it is not generally applied in the computer game domain. DSM can be hard to apply in the computer game domain because of the complexity of computer game domain knowledge and the peculiarity of traditional computer game development process. Without fully understanding these issues and properly solving them, the strength of DSM approaches will be constrained and game developers will be reluctant to use DSM. In this article, we investigate the development process and explore the feasibility of fitting DSM tasks in traditional computer game development in a compact way to lower cost and improve software quality. We introduce the workflow and illustrate the usage of it by presenting a case study. Further, we discuss the benefits and costs of involving DSM solutions in computer game development. Finally, we present the limitations and future work.},

abstract={The management models and skilled workforce required for game development is different from those of traditional software development. Multidisciplinary nature of the game development process requires people with different skills and incurs higher cost as compared to traditional software engineering. Global software engineering (GSE), which involves the development of top level software projects by different teams located around the globe, can be used for game development. The core benefits offered by GSE include reduced costs and increased workforce skillset through coordination of people with diverse expertise. However, such integration of widely distributed teams requires efficient communication and coordination which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a global game development methodology. This methodology makes the game development process more cost effective. In this methodology, we combine the concept of game development methodology with GSE. Furthermore, successful team coordination will be achieved by proper documentation and prototyping in the pre-production phase of our methodology. This combination will provide a means of communicating functionality and interaction as a single package to the team.},

To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development. However, none of the existing GDLCs explicitly address how to successfully deliver a good quality game.

Also, this paper would suggest agile methodologies especially scrum over others in game development, and the reason behind that will be explained. Besides that, there are proposed game development methodologies that could solve the problem of game development by involving three phases, including the preproduction phase, production phase, and post-production phase.

Patients' motivation is indeed hard to maintain when they have to execute repetitive, boring or tedious exercises. In such cases, they tend to practice less regularly and even to entirely give up the therapeutic protocol. Fortunately, therapeutic exercises can very often be turned into compelling games. Such \textit{therapeutic games} are considered as a very promising solution to the patient adherence problem. Yet, therapeutic games are very complex to design : 1. the gameplay is particularly constrained, e.g. the game has to both motivate the patient and provide the therapeutic effects 2. the game must be evaluated on both its medical and motivational results, and 3. relevant health knowledge is hard to share between health experts and game designers. In this paper, we propose a game design method for therapeutic games that provides guidance for every step of the design, along with tools for every design challenges we identified.},

abstract={There are countless of educational game and serious games on the shelf ready to be commercialized. However, at one point the effectiveness of the game in assisting students or children in learning are still questionable. Designing the right design for the game, which emphasizes the users in it, requires particular method and process. The use of participatory design (PD) as a method in designing an educational games is much pertinent to this issue. Hence, this study aims to systematically review the literature on participatory design method for designing educational games by identifying its trends in range of ten years and investigates the process applied to reach the research outcome. Six databases were used in the search: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Emerald Insight, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Taylor and Francis, and Web of Science. The search identified 4387 papers, among them, 4234 were excluded and 153 remains for further selection process. The selection process later cease to 26 papers being evaluated. The selection incorporated all papers, which focused directly on the participatory design process contributing in educational game design and development. Overall, studies lacked a strong link between the participatory design processes evaluation and interpretation of game design elements effectiveness in each process. Participatory design method makes a positive impact on educational game design effectiveness. However, existing processes have not been captured the process evaluation that may be needed. Robust research is needed to address the evaluation of participatory design processes and how to identify the effectiveness of game design using PD method.},

In technology, the growth of ubiquitous computing and the increased use of human computation games (HCGs) create a possibility space for games that convert the serious business of work into the seriously engaging experience of play. HCGs have witnessed a significant growth in the last few years. This chapter outlines the defining characteristics of HCGs. It also outlines the design concept of the human cloud for HCGs. The chapter provides an overview of design patterns in games based on heuristic analysis. There are two dichotomous solutions to the design of HCGs. The first is to determine the problem to be solved and then apply an appropriate game design to it. The second solution is to reverse engineer the game solution by starting with a game. The chapter concludes with a discussion on design models for creating ubiquitous and persuasive play using HCGs.

We interviewed eight video game producers from a range of companies, using a critical incident method to explore risk management practices and risk perceptions. Our results revealed that in lieu of formal risk management practices, these managers relied on prototyping, pre-production decision points, and agile approaches to contain risk on their projects. Among the risk factors mentioned, two are specific to the unique context of video game development. The risk of failing to match the development strategy to the project was identified as a major cause of problems during the development process, and a new risk - the 'fun factor' - was a key element threatening the success of the final game release.},

This analysis highlights the increase in the number of studies that use gamification as an improvement strategy for software project management processes areas. We classified the selected studies by analyzing the type of research method and the type of publication. This analysis shows that it is still an area of research in development and that it is necessary to continue working on the improvement of software project management processes with the aim of contributing to the success of its results.},

However, the underlying processes used in the design of effective purposeful games are understudied. Prominent among these, is the need to understand strategies that designers use to translate content into gameplay. We propose a method to elicit strategies used by designers. Our method uses protocol analysis within an experimental setup to study the purposeful game design process. This paper describes the implementation of the method, and the rationale for our decisions. The method was validated through a set of pilot studies. Through the results of these studies, we discuss the adequacy and limitations of the method and the modifications required. The results of the pilot study provide insights into the game design process. They suggest that our method is capable of revealing strategies used by designers in translating content from problem space to game elements. The main contribution of our work is the selection, adaptation and demonstration of a method to study game design practice in-situ, and thereby create a methodological foundation to discover processes and strategies for effective purposeful game design.},

abstract={Typical education in management of software projects lacks practical experience. But experience is essential in under-standing the problems and especially their solutions. A real software project is difficult to practice because of its long duration and the potential of high damage if the project fails. Simulation games in a sandbox are a well-known approach for practicing complex content. But the design and development of such a game needs much knowledge about all the relevant processes that should be simulated. In this paper, we propose a general framework and a method that can be used for developing project management simulation games for an educational purpose in the software engineering domain. We developed a general simulation model including aspects of ergonomic analysis, work psychology, learning theory and software engineering. With this, we are able to simulate not only the working processes but also the character of the developers. It can be used without understanding the simulation model, so there is no need to understand all the complex content behind. Considering existing solutions, our approach supports different types of games, without making limitations to the game design. We show that with adequate abstraction there is no need to develop an own simulation model for each simulation game. Instead, all relevant aspects can be integrated in a general simulation model.},

abstract={While participatory design (PD) has always been used in the context of community-based design, its application in designing primary school educational games is quite unique and requires total participation from children. Before applying PD in primary schools for game design, there are processes that must be identified. The selection of journal articles and papers are based on rigorous systematic literature review method, with 386 papers and books on participatory design and educational game topic identified, in which 21 were deemed relevant. An analysis table was developed on these selected papers to uncover the series of process and stages applied in the studies. Our analysis reveals that while different fields applies the participatory design process; most of the research share the same theme in the process. Meta analysis technique was used to form a suitable PD process framework from the theme gathered in the analysis. The formed is called the PDEduGame Process Conceptual Framework, which will act as a guide to educational game design. We suggest that the PDEduGame to be used in the context of primary schools in Malaysia.},

abstract={Researchers and game publishers consistently argue digital divide between urban and rural digital gamers in India is due to the lack of affordable and accessible technologies. In this paper, we put forward two perspectives of bridging digital divide in terms of gaming experiences namely technology and cultural perspectives. We are highlighting the potential of several existing technologies in enhancing the gaming experiences of rural and semi-urban populations of India. In addition, we also emphasize on the importance of cultural differences in designing the delivery content for the digital games. We argue that the widely discussed digital divide can be mitigated by considering both technological aspects and cross-cultural aspects of the target users.},

abstract={Educational game design environments have long been employed as an engaging medium for teaching computer programming and software engineering concepts such as objects, agents, instances, behavior, and interaction. However, in contrast to the collaborative nature of programming, in particular among novice programmers, existing game design environments are solitary desktop-based applications with no or very limited support for sharing and collaboration. We have taken advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and its participative culture to develop a collaborative platform around game design activities that encourages social learning and integrates into the students' online social presence and lifestyle. We have employed open-Web technologies to build a game design environment using only HTML5 and JavaScript that lets users practice the game design and programming activities right inside their browser. Game design and game playing run on the client while an associated website hosts the created games and supports collaboration. This paper reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the game design environment. The preliminary evaluation of Agent Web's usability and performance demonstrates that not only does Agent Web meet its design goals, but also that the current Web is a hospitable environment for end-user game programming both on desktop and mobile devices.},

abstract={Engineering training programmes commonly integrate project management skills as a legitimate subject for training competent graduates [7], [5]. Since a few years, this topic has been expanding to lower academic degrees. The challenge is then to combine students' limited technical competences with management requirements and entrepreneurial skills (work experience, staff planning, feedback and even product promotion). The French institutes of technology (such as Grenoble IUT) provide undergraduate technical degrees in different technical specialities with two-year training programmes. In 2013, the programme of the Network and Telecommunication speciality [4] was modernised in this way to :1) introduce project management aspects with 20 hours of lectured training and 30 hours per student of personal work; 2) take into account high-level programming languages and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, ...): 60 hour training must cover the basic algorithmic principles (procedural programming using Python language) but also the operating principles of the applications letting clients query server services. In this paper, we propose to describe the pedagogical approach we adopt to combine these two goals: students work in pairs for 12 weeks and experiment the programming process by developing a game (namely the Battleship) with given technical specifications. This approach offers two major learning points: gaining skills on programming: students are motivated with a fun basic application [3]. Then they are invited to add gaming options with respect to their abilities and with increasing programming complexity (including graphical interface or network gaming service); placing students in a professional situation: student work is driven by well-documented functional specifications and demonstrator programs. Specifications split the project development into four stages with fixed deadlines. Students are in charge of work assignment using classical project management tools and professional collaborative work systems (Gantt diagram and Subversion source version control system [1]). The proposed project is detailed based on our three-year teaching experience focusing on the pedagogical progression, the advantages of IT project management tools and the skills learned by students after this first practical experience.},

abstract={Software project success or failure depends on the ineffective software project management. Success or failure of any project can be attributed incorrect handling of one or more project variables: people, proper technology, proper project scheduling and selection. Among these attributes proper project selection is one of the most vital part of software project management. There exist many uncertainties in project management and current software engineering techniques are unable to eliminate them. So there is huge scope for developing. The current researchers have developed a unique model which is capable to take decision on the field of software project selection. This model has two embedded sub models namely fuzzy AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) and strategic game model. Here in the first case experts opinions are considered under fuzzy environment and in the second case, different decisions makers act as players in the game module. Different criteria are taken into consideration for choosing optimal strategy of the players. An elaborated case study is also analyzed for testing the output of the system.},

The uniqueness of this study is that it focuses on the real world problem of “playing out” the execution phase of a project, rather than the planning phase. Moreover, it better introduces the study of project management areas to students. The study is using a simulation that provides the “players” with the realistic events of individual project scenarios in order to enhance their decision-making skills. The simulation system concentrates on possible risk events that occur during a project's execution phase, the challenges facing the project managers and the evaluation of their decisions. The game is designed for several teams competing among themselves. One hundred and twenty four undergraduate students participated in this test while they studied advanced project management course. In the current paper, we present the statistical analysis, results and conclusions about the contribution of simulation game to study project management.},

abstract={Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

abstract={Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.},

Despite its effective use by the armed forces, emergency responders, negotiators, and political campaign managers, role play is a tool seldom used in STEM classrooms. In this paper, we will describe the incorporation of certain aspects of role play in a game development processes course. This course, similar to courses in software engineering, focuses students on the entire product life cycle and engages them to complete a project from start to finish during the term. We used role play techniques to engage the students more fully in the processes of development by creating a scenario in which the students have suddenly become the owners of an independent game studio. During the semester, we engaged them as the owners on issues of business and legal concerns along with the typical production and process concerns of making their product. We had them face issues of missed deadlines and products that were not ready for production. We have informal evaluation in terms of feedback from end of the semester debriefs and classroom observations. We are using that for further refinements in the next course cycle.},

From the discussion proposed by teachers about the relationship between health and social economic development within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), some principles of Game Design were presented and incorporated in the educational activity. Such principles were applied to enhance practices that comply with the terms of a procedural rhetoric as outlined by Bogost, and most especially, with the terms of typical games's procedurality. Thus, this article serves as an account of a wider movement of integration between students and teachers in the practice of creating and developing ludificated systems aiming at promoting knowledge in the context of the aforementioned subject and, more generally, the Health Professional Education. Considering the game as an educational technology that enhances the knowledge construction process, this article presents an engagement situation and the possibility of developing critical subjectivities with and for the agents involved.},

Exploratory factor analysis with factor loadings of at least 0.50 was utilized to determine the dimensions and the validity of constructs. Reliability of items was ensured through Cronbach's alpha analysis. Items with alpha values of less than 0.70 were discarded. It was found out that Storyline, Aesthetics, Reward System, and Game Objective were the four dimensions of game design scales with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.912, 0.899, 0.916, and 0.906, respectively.

But there are some problems in game design. One of these problems is a game adaptation that can be defined freely as the game's ability to adapt to various factors such as: gamer's skills, emotion playing, layer formats, and hardware platforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based game architecture for designing adaptive text-based computer games that will be used as a delivery of high performance computing (HPC) learning.},

abstract={During the last decade games have become an established vein of entertainment, and consumer culture, and essentially, a common part of people's daily lives. In the United States alone 59% of the population plays computer games while revenues of the computer games industry exceed US $15 billion (ESA, 2014). However, in addition to the increased penetration of games, also the ways in which people play and employ games have become more varied. The long-tail is getting longer: there are more different kinds of games available for a multitude of different platforms that cater for differing gaming needs for widening audiences, and which use a wide variety of business models. Perhaps the most prominent advancement stemming from these developments is "gamification" which generally refers to the increased convergence of games and everyday life. More particularly and practically, gamification commonly refers to the process of enhancing services and systems so that they increase enjoyable and intrinsically motivated use as well as support further behavioral change by employing elements characteristic of games - "Transforming Homo Economicus into Homo Ludens". The "Gamification: Motivations, Effects and Analytics" -minitrack was established to address this growing junction of interests of both scholars and practitioners where games, services and information systems meet and merge. Even though this minitrack is featured at HICSS for the first time and there were two other minitracks competing for game-related submission, this minitrack managed to receive more submissions than the competing tracks as well as an amount of submission that is on par with other popular, more established minitracks. Ultimately, six high quality papers that cover gamification from diverse perspectives were accepted to be presented across two sessions. Gamification is still a rather novel development that suffers from growing pains, and therefore, it has still been under significant conceptual chaos and theoretical turbulence. In "Reimagining gamification through the lens of Activity Theory", Hendranus Vermeulen, James Gain, Patrick Marais and Siobhan O'Donovan seek to contribute to the conceptual and theoretical understanding of gamification by identifying some of the pitfalls in how gamification has been currently conceptualized and perceived, and offering an alternative dialectical perspective for gamification that is based in activity theory. Even though gamification has been very transparently and pervasively acknowledged to be one of the big technology trends during the recent years both in academia and in industry, it has remained opaque as to what kind of technology is being developed around it as well as what kinds of patents companies are filing related to gamification. In "Monitoring Gamification in International Patent Documents: Technology Classes, Firms and Preliminary Value Indicators", Patrick Julian H -- flinger and Eric Zimmerling investigate the international patent documents (from EPO, USTPO and Google Patents) in order to discover what kinds of patents are been filed related to gamification, in which classes of patents and who is filing them. The analysis provides interesting insights in the otherwise previously unexplored area of patents and company interests related to gamification. Increased competition is repeatedly touted as a detrimental side effect of leaderboards and other competition-inducing game mechanics. On the other hand, competition can also potentially increase task performance (at least on the short term). Therefore, competition is a complex issue, and currently, there has been a gap in our knowledge concerning the benefits and detriments of competition. In "When Competition is the Loser", Robin Brouwer untangles how intra-team competition affects perceived task complexity, perceived psychological safety, level of team conflict as well as team performance. The use of information systems and services in healthcare is one of the largest and most impactful areas in HICSS-related sciences. Gamification especially can be seen as a crucial development in this area since one of the main strengths of gamification has been deemed to be its ability to motivate people to take on and maintain difficult habits. In "Design Strategies for Gamified Physical Activity Applications for Older Adults", Dennis Kappen, Lennart Nacke, Kathrin Gerling and Lia Tsotsos explore and suggest design guidelines as to how playful and gameful systems could be harnessed to motivate older adults to maintain physical activity and wellbeing. The authors specifically investigate needs and preferences regarding technologies that support physical activity via semi-structured interviews with 19 older adults and a focus group. Similarly, another promising application areas of gamification has been regarded to exist in supporting sustainable and safe behaviors. In "The Impact of Gamification-Induced Emotions on In-Car IS Adoption -- The Difference between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants", Carolin Ebermann, Everlin Piccinini, Benjamin Brauer, Sebastian Busse and Lutz Kolbe investigate how users' experiences and interactions in an in-car gamification system vary based on their 'digital nativeness' and thus attempt to find optimal ways to design driving-related gamification systems for different kinds of users. Alongside with more traditional game design elements, virtual economies with their virtual currencies and virtual goods have also been shaping gamification designs. In "Why do People Buy Virtual Goods? A Literature Review", Juho Hamari and Lauri Keronen seek to address the question of why do people purchase virtual goods by investigating and synthesizing past (quantitative) literature. Firstly, the study provides an overview to the literature, what, how and where the phenomenon has been studied before. Secondly, by combining results of past literature, the study aims to provide a more reliable, literature spanning look at which factors drive purchase behavior towards virtual goods.},

abstract={General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime" (n other words, they don't know the rules until the game starts). Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover such algorithms themselves. General game playing expertise depends on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence of the programmer of the game player. GGP is an interesting application in its own right. It is intellectually engaging and more than a little fun. But it is much more than that. It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic systems and defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and resource bounds. It has practical applications in areas where these features are important, e.g., in business and law. More fundamentally, it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence. This book is an elementary introduction to General Game Playing (GGP). (1) It presents the theory of General Game Playing and leading GGP technologies. (2) It shows how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs and humans. (3) It offers a glimpse of some of the real-world applications of General Game Playing.

This paper aims to analyze students' opinions about the use of Gamification and Digital Game-Based Learning to teach calculus using an RPG Game and to test a prototype with a group of users. The development of the Fellowship of the Calculus game has three phases: pre-production, production and post-production, in conjunction with the Game Design Document (GDD). A questionnaire was applied to 26 calculus students and a game prototype has been tested with six students to date. Preliminary results show that most of the students enjoy digital games, feel engaged when using the app and would like to play the game as a complement to their studies to help their learning process. The prototype test led to a positive expectation from the students, who showed high interest in using the game in their studies. The prospective work includes applying the game in curriculum to analyze the students' performance and to contribute to the use of computers in the education field.},

In the game design phase, programming game events is time consuming, nonproductive, and tedious burden to programmers. Moreover, it is very difficult task for non-programmers. In this paper, we propose EDGE(Easy Design tool of Game Event for rapid game Development) based game design process which clearly guarantees independence of game planning/implementation phase. In game design process, game designer describe characters and events/effects without programming details. After previewing by EDGE which generated game source codes, we can proceed to the game implementation phase. We designed EDGE on OpenGL platform, applied EDGE to the development of game contents, and the experimental results show that EDGE increase the productivity of game development and maintenance.},

abstract={Educational digital game is nothing new as it has been implemented in multiple discipline and fields, similarly, its effectiveness is undoubtedly high, however the existing direction of research tend to focus to technical aspect of game development such as requirement engineering, algorithms, and UML processes and neglects the game design aspect of the educational game. This study proposes a novel game design methodology that combines Agile-Extreme Programming software development life cycle with game design aspects by using expert testing as a method of validating the game design output of game prototype. This study uses Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) as a method of measuring the game concept as well as a media and subject-matter evaluation questionnaire that measures multiple aspect of game design. The implementation of the proposed methodology is done in three game design steps of ideation, conceptualization, and prototyping. The subject-matter expert review yields a score of 82.2 in term of subject matter correctness and 88.5 in term of question appropriateness, while the media expert review yields a score of 65.7 for software engineering aspect, 65.7 for visual communication aspect, and 73.3 for media design aspect, while the overall CSUQ yields a score of 72.1. The general expert feedbacks on the designed prototype using the proposed methodology are also elaborated thoroughly.},

abstract={Indie game development and academic game prototyping sometimes require a small team or even a single person to develop an entire system. In either case, the deadline could be a serious problem. Chances are that an indie developer or an academic researcher wants to create a very complex game, like a Massively Multiplayer Online Game. This is maybe the worst-case scenario when the resources are very limited. This paper proposes a community-driven narrative to mitigate one of the biggest problems in the creation process: inventing the game story and background. In order to focus on technical development, a game designer can reach a well-established community, with a well-formed self-universe, and create from there instead of from scratch. To demonstrate this creation process, this work uses the Actor-Network Method to analyze the Skynerd Protocol game development case, a player-driven Massively Multiplayer Online Game born from doctoral research about contextual learning in massively games.},

abstract={Different works in the educational field have proposed many applications for serious games (SGs) that have had immense positive impact and great success. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed, and that there is an imbalance between the contribution from experts in education and game design specialists during the SG development. Specifically, methodologies that incorporate both game and pedagogical components in the requirements definition phase are necessary to develop serious games successfully. The definition of requirements must guide the development process. Many SG studies and projects indicates that games that are not well designed at the initial phase lose qualities and fail to fulfill pedagogical objectives. The goal of this study is to present a framework for a game design methodology that gives the gamer options for flexible participation in the game. We analyze the tasks associated with game design methodologies and serious educational games, especially those linked to gamers with non-standard cognitive abilities. Our approach identifies how educational innovation and the teaching-learning process contribute to game design. We propose an overall development focus based on a participatory, flexible, user-centered methodology adaptable to any type of gamer.},

abstract={This Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper examines student game development software projects that replaced a prior end of term project at a large Midwestern university. The use of end of term projects for introductory software courses can increase student engagement and provide a way to summarize and synthesize topics learned in the course. Previous research on a random sample of data has shown that game design projects require significantly higher student effort in the area of programming fundamentals (input/output, repetition structures, selection structures) when compared to prior end of term projects. This current work uses a custom automated Python script to analyze a much larger data set, and examines how game design projects differ from a previous project option in the areas of programming fundamentals and complexity, where complexity is measured using Lines of Code, Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Complexity, and Maintainability Index. The results show that when examining these metrics, the game project requires significantly higher effort as compared to the prior end of term project. This preliminary work will lead to a more in-depth analysis of the results from the automated script, as well as an analysis of additional end of course projects in first-year engineering courses.},

abstract={Background The use of digital media for foreign language learning has been an important topic for years. The possibility of learning with authentic audio-visual material, of communicating with native speakers and being nearly location- and time-independent is a great advantage [Lehner et al., 2008] for learners. Moreover, the number of teenagers who regularly play digital games has grown significantly in the last few years [JIM, 2012]. The project HeaLinGO (Health and Language Integrated Gaming Online), a European-funded initiative established at the Leuphana University (Lueneburg) in 2013, has initiated an evaluation of digital games for foreign language learning (Becker, 2005; Cornollie, 2012; Gee, 2009; Prensky, 2007; Rama, 2012; Sørensen, 2007; Thorne, 2001). In this context "games" are defined as any application with game elements, accordingly the term includes learning platforms and a range of "apps" (Deterding et al., 2011, Werbach, 2012). The first goal of the project was to develop a comprehensive evaluation tool to facilitate the examination of existing applications in this field in terms of both foreign language didactics and digital game-based pedagogy. In addition to providing initial insights into the available digital tools, this data will be made available in a public database for potential language learners, parents, teachers, and researchers to find appropriate language learning programs for their individual purposes. Methods The HeaLinGO researchers developed a survey with more than 80 items (a combination of multiple choice questions and those with open-ended response fields ) identifying the special characteristics of applications for foreign language learning. The questionnaire examined issues in the following categories: background information, didactic analysis, game design, usability, multimedia elements and academic basis. The researchers tested 50 applications and conducted further research into available data about individual programs and tools. Their findings contributed to the development a comprehensive data set for further analysis. This data, analyzed with SPSS 21, forms the basis of results discussed below. Results Preliminary results from the 50 applications tested reveal a number of trends that give insights into the existing state of digital games for foreign language learning. Given that the majority of games and gamified applications emphasize receptive over productive skills, it is questionable whether existing offerings can instruct across the entire range of competencies necessary for second language acquisiton. The overwhelming emphasis on vocabulary and grammar instruction reflects behaviourist pedagogical methods that ignore the situative, task-based, and authentic learning contexts found in progressive foreign language classrooms. Existing platforms, games, and apps struggle with combining strong game design with effective educational design. Conclusion The development of educational games is a complex issue. It seems that that didactic demands and the technological possibilities are often at odds. Despite these challenges, there are some well-designed applications for specific purposes. While testing of applications continues, results thus far indicate some of the difficulties of both designing and implementing applications for language learning in educational settings. By identifying these challenges, it is hoped that some of these obstacles can be better defined and thus addressed.},

This paper introduces a data driven method of creating a gamification pattern language similar to software design patterns to help gamification designers select such elements. Thanks to modern machine learning technologies such a pattern language can be based on a comprehensive empirical analysis to assess the actual use of game design elements in games. This paper is the first report on an ongoing research project that has been carried out since the beginning of 2017 in cooperation with the German Games Archive to extract game design elements from more than 30,000 board games using machine learning techniques. Initial tests based on support vector classification and 4,000 games show that game design elements can be reliably identified with accuracy rates between 80 and 90%.},

abstract={Game development has recently gained a lot of momentum and is now a major software development industry. Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations, games are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology, we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed game test modeling profile. We use domain modeling for representing the game structure and UML state machines for behavioral modeling. We present the details related to automated test case generation, execution, and oracle generation. We demonstrate our model-based testing approach by applying it on two cases studies, a widely referenced and open source implementation of Mario brothers game and an industrial case study of an endless runner game. The proposed approach was able to identify major faults in the open source game implementation. Our results showed that the proposed approach is practical and can be applied successfully on industrial games.},

abstract={Software Engineering is an engineering discipline but lacks a solid theoretical foundation. One effort in remedying this situation has been the SEMAT Essence specification. Essence consists of a language for modeling Software Engineering (SE) practices and methods and a kernel containing what its authors describe as being elements that are present in every software development project. In practice, it is a method agnostic project management tool for SE Projects. Using the language of the specification, Essence can be used to model any software development method or practice. Thus, the specification can potentially be applied to any software development context, making it a powerful tool. However, due to the manual work and the learning process involved in modeling practices with Essence, its initial adoption can be tasking for development teams. Due to the importance of project management in SE projects, new project management tools such as Essence are valuable, and facilitating their adoption is consequently important. To tackle this issue in the case of Essence, we present a game-based approach to teaching the use Essence. In this paper, we gamify the learning process by means of an innovative board game. The game is empirically validated in a study involving students from the IT faculty of University of Jyvaskyla (n=61). Based on the results, we report the effectiveness of the game-based approach to teaching both Essence and SE project work.},

abstract={While research has investigated the application of computational methodologies in undergraduate biology education, those approaches require students certain backgrounds from multiple disciplines. Recently, game design and development for education has moved into different fields of science, including biology. Several multi-media interactive products have been developed to simulate biological mechanisms and can be used by undergraduate students. However these approaches focus on students as game users and, not as game developers. Here, we propose an innovative approach to involve game design and development into undergraduate biology classroom. The approach assumes no additional background, and aims to increase engagement in the complexities of the course material through the process of game design and development. We initialized a case study that systematically combines a game application-driven project into genetics teaching. In the pedagogical experiment, undergraduate biology and computer science students designed educational games to enhance the speed and depth of comprehension of both biological and software engineering concepts. The result of this study shows that the reinforcement effects of biological education games apply differently on students with or without biology backgrounds.},

abstract={Advances in computer gaming technology, digital game design, game engine development, mobile computing, and mobile software engineering, stimulated active research on gamification of processes and activities in "serious" areas such as education, learning, corporate training, management, administration, marketing, simulations of complex physical objects and phenomena, engineering, project management, Wellness, healthcare, chemistry, and other areas. The performed analysis of the current status of serious games' applications in industry clearly shows that it will soon need a significant number of well educated and highly skilled specialists in gamification of main business processes, including serious games' software engineers, analysts, designers, developers, testers, etc. The findings and outcomes of performed analysis motivated the authors - faculty and graduate student at Bradley University (Peoria, IL, U.S.A.) - to work collaboratively, propose a new approach and ways of gamification of software engineering curriculum.},

abstract={We introduce a new layered modeling architecture consisting of dynamic hybrid fault modeling and extended evolutionary game theory for reliability, survivability, and fault tolerance analyses. The architecture extends traditional hybrid fault models and their relevant constraints in the Agreement algorithms with survival analysis, and evolutionary game theory. The dynamic hybrid fault modeling (i) transforms hybrid fault models into time- and covariate-dependent models; (ii) makes real-time prediction of reliability more realistic, and allows for real-time prediction of fault-tolerance; (iii) sets the foundation for integrating hybrid fault models with reliability and survivability analyses by integrating them with evolutionary game modeling; and (iv) extends evolutionary game theory by stochastically modeling the survival (or fitness) and behavior of `game players.' To analyse survivability, we extend dynamic hybrid fault modeling with a third-layer, operational level modeling, to develop the three-layer survivability analysis approach (dynamic hybrid fault modeling constitutes the tactical and strategic levels). From the perspective of evolutionary game modeling, the two mathematical fields, i.e., survival analysis and agreement algorithms, which we applied for developing dynamic hybrid fault modeling, can also be utilized to extend the power of evolutionary game theory in modeling complex engineering, biological (ecological), and social systems. Indeed, a common property of the areas where our extensions to evolutionary game theory can be advantageous is that the risk analysis and management are a core issue. Survival analysis (including competing risks analysis, and multivariate survival analysis) offers powerful modeling tools to analyse time-, space-, and/or covariate-dependent uncertainty, vulnerability, and/or frailty which `game players' may experience. The agreement algorithms, which are not limited to the agreement algorithms from distributed computing, when applied to extend evolutionary game modeling, can be any problem (game system) specific rules (algorithms or models) that can be utilized to dynamically check the consensus among game players. We expect that the modeling architecture and approaches discussed in the study should be implemented as a software environment to deal with the necessary sophistication. Evolutionary computing should be particularly convenient to serve as the core optimization engine, and should simplify the implementation. Accordingly, a brief discussion on the software architecture is presented.},

abstract={Automatically generating content for videogames has long been a staple of game development and the focus of much successful research. Such forays into content generation usually concern themselves with producing a specific game component, such as a level design. This has proven a rich and challenging area of research, but in focusing on creating separate parts of a larger game, we miss out on the most challenging and interesting aspects of game development. By expanding our scope to the automated design of entire games, we can investigate the relationship between the different creative tasks undertaken in game development, tackle the higher level creative challenges of game design, and ultimately build systems capable of much greater novelty, surprise, and quality in their output. This paper, the first in a series of two, describes two case studies in automating game design, proposing cooperative coevolution as a useful technique to use within systems that automate this process. We show how this technique allows essentially separate content generators to produce content that complements each other. We also describe systems that have used this to design games with subtle emergent effects. After introducing the technique and its technical basis in this paper, in the second paper in the series we discuss higher level issues in automated game design, such as potential overlap with computational creativity and the issue of evaluation.},

abstract={This Work-in-Progress paper reports on the development of a Mixed Reality (MR) game prototype via HoloLens and Unity Engine. We aim to investigate how we can incorporate immersive multimedia technologies such as HoloLens as a potential form of STEM learning for students. This paper also proposes methods for testing the game's effectiveness as a learning tool. In our research, we have developed a prototype of a Desalination Plant in the Mixed Reality model application using the Game Development software called Unity engine. The MR app includes interactions and animations added to the 3D Industrial model, and we crossbuilt the Unity application to the HoloLens device, allowing the user to interact with the model in a real-world environment. The game aims to stimulate competition by introducing time constraints, game levels and a point system to incentivize students by developing their analytical skills. The game will be followed by a survey tool to assess the educational impact of the game and whether it was beneficial for the students in aiding them in the learning process. The research team has drawn upon the experiences of the Petroleum Engineering department at Texas A&M University at Qatar, who implemented a virtual reality application visualizing LNG spill and Dispersion in one of their research projects [1]. However, in our project, we aim to not only simulate the facility for visualization purposes but also to provide more interactive content for the users in STEM courses and increase students' comprehension of specific topics. In the process of designing the MR game, we aim to address the following research questions: 1) Do students' motivation to learn about plant design and process safety procedures improve after implementing MR? & 2) To what extent can a MR game application teach students to synthesize and design processes typically encountered in the desalination plant to meet needs within realistic constraints such as economics, safety, health & the environment?},

abstract={Learning games are becoming popular among teachers as educational tools. However, despite all the game development quality processes (e.g., beta testing), there is no total assurance about the game design appropriateness to the students' cognitive skills until the games are used in the classroom. Furthermore, games designed specifically for Intellectual Disabled (ID) users are even harder to evaluate because of the communication issues that this type of players have. ID users' feedback about their learning experience is complex to obtain and not always fully reliable. To address this problem, we use an evidence-based approach for evaluating the game design of Downtown, A Subway Adventure, a game created to improve independent living in users with ID. In this paper we exemplify the whole process of applying Game Analytics techniques to gather actual users' gameplay interaction data in real settings for evaluating the design. Following this process, researchers were able to validate different game aspects (e.g., mechanics) and could also identify game flaws that may be difficult to detect using formative evaluation or other observational-based methods. Results showed that the proposed evidence-based approach using Game Analytics information is an effective way to evaluate both the game design and the implementation, especially in situations where other types of evaluations that require users' involvement are limited.},

abstract={Teaching software engineers presents some specific problems. There are modern approaches that may make the education process easier and more appealing. A remarkably promising example of this is the use of computer games in the teaching and learning process. We suggest a methodology of two-fold use of learning games for teaching software engineers. Students, experienced in programming, develop learning games, and then we use the games that are developed for teaching the next generation of students. After gaining skills in basic subjects these students are involved in the development of new learning games. Teachers in our department play the role of customer, as they are interested in getting new effective tools for teaching and are ready to participate in our work. Students developing games learn all the software development life cycle phases including testing, deployment and maintenance, they contact real customers (teachers of corresponding subjects) and real users (students, learning these subjects). Student teams have developed several games that are used for teaching new students. Students, who participated in game development, gained such important professional skills as software design, testing, debugging and development, working with open source libraries, version controls systems, other modern tools and domain-specific programming languages. Students were also trained in soft skills such as team working, project management, and conflict resolution. Teachers, using games as learning systems, notice an improvement in students' motivation in learning and their will to be involved into the learning process. Our experience of using computer games shows that this approach is very effective for improving students' skills and motivation to study.},

However, the relationship between the Software Engineering methodologies, with the requirement described in the Game Design Document, and the Instructional Design have not been discussed together. This paper proposes a conceptual model and discusses their relations among those domains, that aims to fill this gap. In order to define the model, those approaches available were analyzed and compared, then suggests several components needed for game design. It describes the primary structure focus on four phases Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation, which identifies and validates the roles of all components to achieve the desired educational goals.

In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second, the study main result: the ``old days" are gone, but not completely. Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65% of projects in which 45% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30% of projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and opportunities for video game development community.},

Game design patterns are being introduced to solve the particular type of problems for the development of computer games. The formal and informal specifications of game design patterns exist because of differences in implementation, design requirements and programming languages. We analyzed the state of the art related to mobile game design patterns and realized that mobile applications are developed by using mobile game design patterns for the development of quality software applications. The recovery of mobile game design patterns is helpful for the comprehension, reverse engineering, maintenance, evolution and refactoring of software applications.

abstract={The attention to computer game-based learning has grown as research continues to demonstrate its effectiveness for education. Games have been proven to be an effective tool in supplementing conventional teaching methods. However, prior to the development of such educational game, in order to be effective, it is essential that pedagogic concerns are addressed first and integrated into the game design process. Educational games cannot be designed and developed exclusively by instructional designers, or exclusively by game developers, because the former know little about game development, and the latter know little about the science of teaching and learning. As such, development of educational games requires both the instructional designer and game developer to be equally involved during the design stage. This paper presented a comparative summary of the phases involved in the Instructional Design Process and Tasks, and the Game Design Process and Products. This paper also included a brief overview of the Game Concept and Design Document and discussed how it can be adapted for construction education.},

abstract={Today, video games are a multi-billion-dollar industry, continuously evolving through the incorporation of new technologies and innovative design. However, current video game software content creation requires extensive and often-times ambiguous planning phases for developing aesthetics, online capabilities, and gameplay mechanics. Design elements can vary significantly relative to the expertise of artists, designers, budget, and overall game engine/software features and capabilities. Game development processes are often extensively long coding sessions, usually involving a highly iterative creative process, where user requirements are rarely provided. Therefore, we propose significantly simplifying game design and development with novel Artificial Cognition Architecture real-time scalability and dynamic emotion core. Rather than utilizing more static emotion state weighting emotion engines (e.g. ExAI), we leverage significant ACA research in successful implementation of analog neural learning bots with Maslowan objective function algorithms. We also leverage AI- based Artificial Psychology software which utilizes ACA's fine grained self-evolving emotion modeling in humanistic avatar patients for Psychologist training. An ACA common cognitive core provides the gaming industry with wider applications across video game genres. A modular, scalable, and cognitive emotion game architecture implements Non-Playable Character (NPC) learning and self-evolution. ACA models NPC's with fine grained emotions, providing interactive dynamic personality traits for a more realistic game environment and enables NPC self-evolution under the influence of both other NPC's and players. Furthermore, we explore current video game design engine architecture (e.g. Unity, Unreal Engine) and propose an ACA integration approach. We apply artificial cognition and emotion intelligence modeling to engender video games with more distinct, realistic consumer gaming experiences, while simultaneously minimizing software gaming development efforts and costs.},

abstract={Recent studies from the Bogota Chamber of Commerce (Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá) in the field of digital animation and video games in Colombia show an accelerated growth of this industry in the last decade, positioning it as one of the most important for years to come. However, this strategic sector has very few adequate specialized academic training in the country, as identified in the study of Animation and Video Games Education [1]. This explains why a study by Universidad de los Andes in 2012, in collaboration with the Ministry of ICT and PROEXPORT, on the domestic supply of digital content, in Colombia people dedicated to this work are mostly professionals in design and systems engineers, programs that now have no specific training for this industry. This makes harder the process of production and game development for the companies, and increases investment costs and time needed to train professionals in the workplace. So, it is necessary to give specialized education in video games. We designed a postgraduate program in Game Development that aims to the needs expressed by this contemporary productive sector. Its aim is to prepare professionals to achieve the creation of high-impact video games for different platforms and devices. The goal is training leaders that will give to the development of projects that promote interdisciplinary and teamwork who are skilled in the production and understand the design process and development of video games. In order to reach a wider audience in different regions of the country and responding to the needs of industry, this program will be offered in blended learning model, which will promote flexibility and autonomous learning. The program aims to prepare professionals from various branches to direct own projects game industry, able to coordinate and lead interdisciplinary working groups. Throughout the postgraduate program, students will develop specific skills in the area of their choice, which can be programming, graphic art or audio.},

abstract={Teaching mathematics has received priority in schools, because mathematics is the basis for development in understanding mathematics as a whole at school. Computer technology used in teaching and learning can help improve children's preferences and abilities to learn mathematics in class, and can change attitudes of early childhood who are more critical, creative, and innovative. Jarimagic method is one method for learning to count on the fingers, where early childhood often communicate with fingers in learning mathematics in the classroom. For this reason, research attempts learning methods with interactive games with hand movements using the Jarimajic method and tools scratch 2.0. In this study, evaluation of data obtained through 20 child respondents was carried out by testing before using the game and after using the game, using Pre-Test and Post-Test analysis, which was divided into 2 results based on the preferences and abilities of early childhood learning mathematics in the classroom. From the study, the game development was carried out using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) method by taking the model of implementation the waterfall model. then a game is designed to overcome this problem. After the game is made, the game will be tested again for early childhood, with T-Test statistical analysis as the final data obtained from research that shows whether early childhood likes and increases ability to learn mathematics after the game is implemented. The results of this study are the realization of interactive game-based learning methods for early childhood in learning to count mathematics. especially in learning additions and collection using the jarimajic method so that children have the ability and preference in learning mathematics.},

abstract={Serious games have been and currently are used for multiple purposes other than just entertainment, such as education, healthcare or emergency management. This research presents game-design elements based on specific functional and professional requirements among which usability plays a key role. The aim of the research is to steer the direction towards a game-design framework for evidence-based clinical procedure libraries (eCPL). For context analysis and game-element presentation, a "serious application" example is shown to illustrate the improvement through game-design elements. A context analysis was required to select suitable game-design elements to target system usability and solve system design problems. The game-based context analysis addressed gamification themes and games that match those themes. The matching themes can be further analysed to find game-design elements to solve problems or enhance existing functions. The game-design elements found in this research include immersion, support for different roles, flow enhancement, visual enhancement, learning stages and experience level support, design for interactivity and progress.},

It significantly reduces the tedious complexity of RPG, also speeds up the game development cycle. The proposed “Homeland Defence” consists of several core parts, such as inventory system, monster module and archive function. This game owns the quest reward mechanism which poses various kinds of value-added gains for the participants. Virtual cooperation ingredients easily satisfy the game players without any real scenario consumption at any time.

abstract={Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.},

abstract={Procedural content generation is helping game developers to create significant quantity of high quality dynamic content for video games at a fraction of cost of the traditional methods. Procedural texture synthesis is a sub category of procedural content generation which helps video games to have significant variations in textures of the environments and the objects across the progress of the game and to avoid repetition. Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms which are capable of learning the patterns and creating new patterns. In this paper, Generative Adversarial Networks is used for procedural content generation for original textures synthesis for video game development. This method is used by video game designers for autonomous redesigning of objects and environment textures. This process saves significant time and cost in video game development. The particular attention in this paper is on procedural synthesis of ground surface textures. The generated texture samples are visually acceptable and have mean score of 2.45 with 0.1 standard deviation after 2K iteration. Also the discriminator loss of generated samples reached 0.74 at the final stage of training. The proposed framework can be used as an effective procedural texture synthesis framework for video game design and development.},

abstract={By using game design as a method to teach in various subjects apart from software engineering and media design, the evaluation of the project We Make Games aimed at finding out what participating teachers think about the approach. The first part of the project saw a train-the-trainer workshop, distance teacher training and implementing the serious game-design method in classes. The accompanying evaluation had a closer look at teachers' previous knowledge regarding (serious) digital games, their expectations and attitudes towards the project, games and game-design as well as the outcome of the project and the participating students' learning effects. Therefore, a mixed methods approach was used. Results show that teachers who are not familiar with game-design concepts need extensive training and support before using the method in their classes. Moreover, constraints because of time and organizational framework in schools make an implementation more difficult. However, motivation and engagement of students generally increased as well as their problem-solving skills.},

abstract={Design and development of multi-player network games is a complex and involved process. Apart from standard software development complexity, the game designer has to carefully think about issues like playability, user experience and scalability aspects of the game during the design phase itself. Most of the existing methodologies to determine playability of a multiplayer game with a targeted user experience level are only applied after the game is developed. This is highly undesirable as it incurs a high cost because multiple design and development cycles are involved that take time and increase development complexity. We propose a simulation technique that can be used to validate the playability of a game in terms of quality of experience of end-users prior to full game development. The simulation output can also provide some guidelines to the resource planning of the game server with respect to targeted requirements for user experience. Our goal in developing this tool is to make it generic and versatile at the same time staying reasonably true to the real game strategy so that it is useful for the game designers to quickly run a simulation to get insight about the game playability before the actual development process.},

pages={445-450},
abstract={Crowd sourcing systems call a crowd of users to collaborate on solving real-life problems. One key issue for the success of such systems is to guarantee users' participation. A strategy that has been used to promote user participation is the use of game design techniques, since games have successful strategies to grant enjoyable user experience. However, most gamification methods and guidelines are too generic, do not emphasize the collaboration aspects and focus on introducing rewarding elements into the application, instead of designing player-centric applications. Reward-based design is dangerous, specially for collaborative systems, because it may put points gathering as the primary purpose of the application instead of the collaboration goal. This paper presents G.A.M.E., a conceptual framework to guide the design of gamification in crowd sourcing-based systems. The framework provides a flexible step-by-step guideline that combines knowledge from software engineering, collaborative systems, game design and interaction design. To evaluate our proposal, we instantiated G.A.M.E. Into two applications in the domain of public transportation. The influence of gamification in those applications were evaluated through controlled navigation tests in a crowd sourcing usability testing platform. Our findings showed us that gamification improved user interfaces of collaboration activities by 16% on usability and were more trustworthy in 80% the cases.},

Although Game Design can be understood with simple rulesets that define basic game mechanics, it can become a complex problem when many different rules get involved. Moreover, coming up with innovations in this field can be a daunting creative task. Other fields of game development like content creation and procedural generation have created automated tools to facilitate process, but this has not yet been materialized for basic Game Design and prototyping. MaruGen (Machinations Ruleset Generator) is a procedural L-System based tool that aims to fill this gap by creating complex rule-sets from a formal grammar, based on proved simple ones, in an attempt to automate design and encourage innovation via the emergent nature of the rulesets themselves.},

abstract={This Work-In-Progress falls within the research category of study and, focuses on the experiences and perceptions of first-and second year engineering students when using an online engineering game that was designed to enhance understanding of statics concepts. Technology and online games are increasingly being used in engineering education to help students gain competencies in technical domains in the engineering field. Less is known about the way that these online games are designed and incorporated into the classroom environment and how these factors can ignite inequitable perspectives and experiences among engineering students. Also, little if any work that combines the TAM model and intersectionality of race and gender in engineering education has been done, though several studies have been modified to account for gender or race. This study expands upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by exploring perspectives of intersectional groups (defined as women of color who are engineering students). A Mixed Method Sequential Exploratory Research Design approach was used that extends the TAM model. Students were asked to play the engineering educational game, complete an open-ended questionnaire and then to participate in a focus group. Early findings suggest that while many students were open to learning to use the game and recommended inclusion of online engineering educational games as learning tools in classrooms, only a few indicated that they would use this tool to prepare for exams or technical job interviews. Some of the main themes identified in this study included unintended perpetuation of inequality through bias in favor of students who enjoyed competition-based learning and assessment of knowledge, and bias for students having prior experience in playing online games. Competition-based assessment related to presumed learning of course content enhanced student anxiety and feelings of intimidation and led to some students seeking to “game the game” versus learning the material, in efforts to achieve grade goals. Other students associated use of the game and the classroom weighted grading with intense stress that led them to prematurely stop the use of the engineering tool. Initial findings indicate that both game design and how technology is incorporated into the grading and testing of learning outcomes, influence student perceptions of the technology's usefulness and ultimately the acceptance of the online game as a “learning tool.” Results also point to the need to explore how the crediting and assessment of students' performance and learning gains in these types of games could yield inequitable experiences in these types of courses.},

abstract={With the rapidly evolving mobile game industry it has become increasingly lucrative to develop quickly across as many different platforms as possible. There is a great number of Open Source Software libraries which help with the different aspects of cross-platform game development. Nonetheless there is still a great deal of low level systems to be crafted to deal with each platform, a process far more complex than the game design and development process. This is a large discouragement to cross-platform development and has resulted in many companies specializing on the costly and complex process of porting games from platform to platform. The lack of simple cross platform development tools reduces developers' target consumer range, and thus revenue. The solution is an intuitive game development tool, based on a range of Open Source Software packages to easily create cross-platform games. The complex interweaving of graphics, audio, physics, scripting, input and file systems can be completed by the tool leaving developers to focus wholly on the game creation. The majority of the code can be written for the general case, and then platform specific input and file systems configurations can be added to make for more natural gameplay experiences on each platform. A graphical UI would enhance the development process of creative games, allowing for easy addition of specific cases for each platform where required. In short, the tool will remove the overwhelmingly complex process of cross-platform development into a seamless and intuitive experience.},

abstract={Human Computing (HC) is a successful approach to crowdsourcing scientific research. Despite its success, many HC projects struggle to expand their user base and create sustained user engagement. In contrast, the commercial video game industry overall is very successful at encouraging users to spend significant time and resources to play over extended stretches of time, using techniques such as gameplay loops to engage players on many levels. When integrating scientific research into a video game, ideally the HC activities fit naturally within the gameplay loops and overall game themes, which game developers are best suited to accomplish. The authors propose a new HC to Video Games (HCtVG) model and associated framework, which provides a common means to connect HC research and video game developers. The HCtVG model comprises two major phases: Deconstruction and Analysis (DA) done by the researchers, and Game Integration (GI) completed by the game developers. During the DA, researchers deconstruct their research into a 5-Step Analysis Structure (5SAS) consisting of Suggest, Validate, Process, Select, and Exit steps. The 5SAS allows game developers to perform the GI phase, using the guidelines provided to integrate the HC activity into the gameplay and theme. This structure allows scientists to focus on their domain expertise while leveraging the skills of the game development community to design their video game integration. To demonstrate the HCtVG model, the authors apply the DA phase to an HC project seeking the discovery of chemotherapeutic co-medication properties for multi-drug resistant cancer research, and use the GI phase to design and integrate the HC activity into the popular game Minecraft.},

abstract={The collection and analysis of behavioral telemetry in digital games has in the past five years become an integral part of game development. One of the key challenges in game analytics is the development of methods for characterizing and predicting player behavior as it evolves over time. Characterizing behavior is necessary for monitoring player populations and gradually improve game design and the playing experience. Predicting behavior is necessary to describe player engagement and prevent future player churn. In this paper, methods and theory from kernel archetype analysis and random process models are utilized to evaluate the playtime behavior, i.e. time spent playing specific games as a function of time, of over 6 million players, across more than 3000 PC and console games from the Steam platform, covering a combined playtime of more than 5 billion hours. A number of conclusions can be derived from this large-scale analysis, notably that playtime as a function of time, across the thousands of games in the dataset, and irrespective of local differences in the playtime frequency distribution, can be modeled using the same model: the Weibull distribution. This suggests that there are fundamental properties governing player engagement as it evolves over time, which we here refer to as the Playtime Principle. Additionally, the analysis shows that there are distinct clusters, or archetypes, in the playtime frequency distributions of the investigated games. These archetypal groups correspond to specific playtime distributions. Finally, the analysis reveals information about player behavior across a very large dataset, showing for example that the vast majority of games are players for less than 10 hours, and very few players spend more than 30-35 hours on any specific game.},

abstract={Bugs that persist into releases of video games can have negative impacts on both developers and users, but particular aspects of testing in game development can lead to difficulties in effectively catching these missed bugs. It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types. Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from greater attention in order to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our results in devising tools and methods to better identify and address certain bug types.},

abstract={Research problem: Gamification is a concept that originates from the digital media domain. It includes a process of enhancing a service using game design elements in nongame contexts. Although much research exists on gamification, very few studies focus on the application of gamification in the enterprise. Research questions: (1) How do managers currently use and experience gamification as a communication medium? (2) Why is it that few instances of gamification exist in enterprise management? (3) Is gamification's own branding somehow cannibalizing itself in enterprise applications? Literature review: We reviewed gamification literature in the workplace and looked at the applicability of game design elements within the enterprise culture. Enterprise gamification is still considered uncharted territory, and more research on gamification in the enterprise is needed. But existing research studies support our claims that there is high potential for enterprise gamification that needs to be explored. Methodology: Observations were made during fieldwork with an exploratory interview research approach. These observations were put to test via an online psychological single-blind controlled quantitative experiment conducted with 198 survey respondents to investigate the effect of branding on gamification and its perception in the enterprise context. Results and conclusions: The results show that using the “gamification” brand clearly drives lower rates of perceived acceptance of the concept, whereas using an “unbranded” version of the same gamification concepts results in comparatively higher rates of perceived acceptance and a general willingness to adopt within the enterprise context. The results also confirm that “interest” and “branding” are interrelated, and that gamification faces higher rates of resistance, lower rates of adoption, and lower success rates in the enterprise compared to other fields. Thus, enterprise gamification may not be correctly branded, and our research recommends the use of a set of procedural, prepackaged best practices, in the form of an implementation framework, to guarantee optimal design and implementation.},

Studies have shown that applying Gamification elements in websites engage user's attention and thinking skills. Gamification refers to the use of game elements in a non-game context to increase engagement between humans and computers. There are various methodologies for educational game development, which combining instructional design with learning theories. The objective of this paper is to discuss a comprehensive methodology for developing and validating a Gamification-Based Programming Learning Framework. The framework are constructed by integrating learning theories, game elements and programming learning requirements. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are employed. The methodology are divided into three phases namely, analysis, innovation and validation. Each phase consists of steps and evaluation which must be completed before moving to the next phase. This methodology could be adapted by other researchers to develop a learning-based or game-based learning framework.},

abstract={The use of games and game elements in software engineering education is not new. In fact, their use in Software Engineering education is found in research papers since 1974, with a notorious increase after 2000. However, there is little information about the actual adoption of these approaches in software engineering education. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate the use of games and game elements in software engineering education, in the perspective of educators. To achieve this goal, this study proposes and analyzes the results of a survey answered by 88 software engineering professors. We sample the participants by inviting 285 educators mined from one hundred well-stablished universities and educational institutions of different regions of Brazil. The goal of the survey is (i) to collect information about the use of games and gamification in classrooms and (ii) to understand the relation of ACM/IEEE knowledge areas and the used game-related methods. The results show that most of the professors are aware of these educational approaches, the games were adopted by only 21 participants and game elements were only adopted by 19 participants. Games are most used to cover “Software Process” and “Project Management”. The most used game elements are Points, Quizzes, and Challenges. The results also show that the main reasons for not adopting the resources are the lack of knowledge, lack of information about relevant games for teaching software engineering, and the lack of time to plan and include these approaches in the classroom. Finally, results show a positive tendency towards the future adoption of these game-related approaches by the software engineering professors.},

abstract={For several years empirical studies have spanned the spectrum of research from software productivity, quality, reliability, performance to human computer interaction. Analyses have involved software systems ranging from desktop software to telecommunication switching systems. But surprising there has been little work done on the emerging digital game industry, one of the fastest growing domains today. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first empirical analysis of a large commercially successful game system. In this paper, we introduce an analysis of the significant user data generated in the gaming industry by using a successful game: Project Gotham Racing 4. More specifically, due to the increasing ubiquity of constantly connected high-speed internet connections for game consoles, developers are able to collect extensive amounts of data about their games following release. The challenge now is to make sense of that data, and from it be able to make recommendations to developers. This paper presents an empirical case study analyzing the data collected from a released game over a three year period. The results of this analysis include a better understanding of the differences between long-term and short-term players, and the extent to which various options in the game are utilized. This led to recommendations for future development ways to reduce development costs and to keep new players engaged. A secondary goal for this paper is to introduce software game development as a topic of importance to the empirical software engineering community and discuss research results on a key difference area: data analytics on user data to customize user and development experiences.},

abstract={This paper debates the necessity of implementing Virtual Reality Technology as a training tool within Lean Manufacturing Environments (LME). The topic for discussion surrounding this area is the need for a user friendly package that utilizes game and advanced Virtual Reality (VR) Technology to encompass the principles of the Lean approach to manufacturing. Fundamental principles adopted by video game developers attempting to immerse the user could provide a key, through allowing for a fully immersive manufacturing simulation software package. The implementation of VR and training software that would not only teach, but also showcase new technology and show its relevance in a manufacturing system. As a result the use of Lean philosophy acts as a conduit in the implementation of the VR software in adaptable modern manufacturing. Literature within Lean Manufacturing and Video Game Development Immersion Methodologies allow for a juxtaposition between the two, through promoting the validity of novel simulation training techniques. Evaluating case studies of Lean Manufacturing applications will ascertain the need for innovative adaptations, by determining whether solutions could be further improved by latest technological advancements. This paper critically appraises gaming technology and its evolution towards sophisticated design solutions. Learning theories adopted through gaming reveal new approaches to motivational drivers in developing necessary skill sets for modern workforces. Studies surrounding objective based instructional learning highlight rarely acknowledged fields in manufacturing simulation testing. Project Sponsor: Nottingham Trent University & PepsiCo The simulation software is to be built using Unity3D with scripting in C# and Java Script which emulates running of a manufacturing cell within a Lean environment. Its purpose is to train and educate personnel through simulating a functioning manufacturing cell. The software displays potential Lean wastes and problems such as bottle necking. It is imperative to the development of modern manufacturing environments that new simulation techniques in educating workforces, creating prototypes and testing are embraced. Currently only the latter two developments are predominantly created in unison. In Lean, this is wasteful in terms of transport and skill if these are not performed in-house. The need for a more user friendly and intuitive simulation experience requires clarity for potential manufacturers in order to adopt this methodology. Not enough varied Lean manufacturing companies embody Lean principles on a computational software level and as a result could potentially leave entire generations without modern manufacturing skill sets. The concept of VR used in modern Manufacturing Simulation Software (MSS) can be utilised to dispel any belief that VR is solely an entertainment medium. Through examination of Lean Principles and Video Game Development immersion strategies this research highlights the little recognized area of an Immersive Manufacturing Training and Design Testing Application. It is clear that Modern manufacturing environments need to become aware of Lean philosophies of adaptability. There is a requirement to inform companies about utilisation of the latest technologies in order to educate workforces in an efficient and Lean manner. The software runs a simulation on a Zspace 3D display screen in a 3D VR format.},

abstract={Software development, like any prolonged and intellectually demanding activity, can negatively affect the motivation of developers. This is especially true in specific areas of software engineering, such as requirements engineering, test-driven development, bug reporting and fixing, where the creative aspects of programming fall short. The developers' engagement might progressively degrade, potentially impacting their work's quality. Gamification, the use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts, is hailed as a means to boost the motivation of people for a wide range of rote activities. Indeed, well-designed games deeply involve gamers in a positive loop of production, feedback, and reward, eliciting desirable feelings like happiness and collaboration. The question we investigate is how the seemingly frivolous context of games and gamification can be ported to the technically challenging and sober domain of software engineering. Our investigation starts with a review of the state of the art of gamification, supported by a motivating scenario to expose how gamification elements can be integrated in software engineering. We provide a set of basic building blocks to apply gamification techniques, present a conceptual framework to do so, illustrated in two usage contexts, and critically discuss our findings.},

pages={1251-1256},
abstract={Digital games or computer game playing can be considered as a psychological activity. Many psychological studies have been undertaken and numerous hypotheses have been created about game playing, partly to assist with game design. Psychophysiology, a field of psychology and physiology, has also been applied as a tool for game design and game science in the belief that psychophysiological or physiological measurements and their interpretation could be helpful for game development. However, practical problems with measurements arise in attaching sensors to players. In contrast, virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays for gaming have seen rapid development in recent years and have been commercialized for the general public. These VR display headsets must be fixed on the player's head while playing. We realized that a physiological measurement could be autonomously realized if the sensor device was embedded in the VR headset. Here, we propose a novel concept of physiological measurement that is highly compatible with gaming VR headsets. Our system can collect unconstrained physiological measurements during game playing. As a first attempt of this concept, photoplethysmography (PPG)-arterial pulse measurement using light to derive the heart rate-was embedded in a headset and its heart rate measurement was evaluated. A novel photoplethysmograph embedded in a head-mounted VR headset was designed and realized. Reflectance-type PPG using green light gave stable measurements under several conditions such as alternating light emission from the headset display, blinking by the subject, and breathing change. Heart rate changes during a VR game can thus be measured while wearing VR glasses by using the photoplethysmograph. We expect that embedded physiological measurement using these VR glasses can be utilized for health management in the near future.},

abstract={In general, videogame development is a difficult and specialist activity. We believe that providing an immediate feedback cycle (liveness) in the software used to develop games may enable greater productivity, creativity and enjoyment for both professional and amateur creators. There are many different methods for achieving interactivity and immediate feedback in software development, including read-eval-print loops, edit-and-continue debuggers and dataflow programming environments. These approaches have each found success in domains they are well-suited to, but games are particularly challenging due to their interactivity and strict performance requirements. We discuss here the applicability of some of these ideas to game development, and then outline a proposal for a live programming model suited to the unique technical challenges of game development. Our approach seeks to provide an extensible way to automate the process of obtaining feedback, through the use of a reactive programming model and dataflow-style UI. We describe our progress in implementing this design, with reference to a simple example game.},

abstract={Games and Machine Learning (ML) most commonly intersect in the areas: 1) ML testing in Games, 2) ML use for Game-AI and 3) ML use for game assets. These areas have seen strong interest in the past, but the use of ML as main game mechanic has been less explored so far. Most likely due to a lack of real-time learning capabilities and inaccessibility of algorithms to the gaming community in the past. While some game-like experiences like the "Game of life"-type simulations exist and versions of it use ML, these usually provide minimal interaction and confine the player to initial parameter setup and subsequent watching of a simulation. This paper describes a digital game prototype which explores using Demonstrative Learning in a multi-player setting as main game mechanic, to achieve interaction levels similar to Interactive Machine Learning. We describe the process the considerations that have led to using this type of ML among other decisions related to finding suitable compromises between capabilities and needs of ML and ideal player experience. The prototype is used to discuss game design choices and shows how a focus on the ML-mechanics can inspire game design and facilitate creative design and future research and design possibilities.},

abstract={The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has shown to be an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration sometimes decrease motivation of students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at Gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification in education is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. To help the adequate use of gamification in collaborative learning activities we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS in order to formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in CL situations. This paper will present the ontological structure to represent gamified CL scenarios and show the utility of our approach to define personalized conceptual models to gamify CL scenario based on students' needs and individual characteristics.},

abstract={Many computer applications require solving difficult problems (NP or PSPACE), which can be expensive to analyze the space of feasible solutions. In the last 20 years, the theoretical computer science area showed enormous progress in the algorithm design that is not being put in practice. Experimental algorithmic can help to bridge the gap between theory and practice. A domain of applications that involves hard problems is the development of computer games, in particular, games in which the user's opponent is the computer. Heuristic search technique in games has been highly successful, however, there are no tools to assist in testing and improving implementations based on it. In this paper, we describe a framework called GLIESE that focuses on the reuse of software components for experimental game development. Its main goal is to provide software support to simplify the most complex issues in the implementation of video games enabling to experiment with games in which parts of its logic can be expressed by using different heuristic searches. The simulation and assess of the quality of approximate solution based on different heuristic search techniques is the original aspect that impacts on the game implementation. GLIESE was used in undergraduate courses of "Analysis and Design of Algorithms" in the development of variety of popular games.},

abstract={Recently, educational games are gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in the learning field. This is because they are fun, motivating and immersive. However, designing educational games can be difficult for people who do not have appropriate background towards game development. This is further complicated by the fact that there are many genres of games (role playing, action, puzzle, etc.) and each genre has its own game elements and functionalities. This makes the game design process confusing, especially for beginners. This paper deploys the powerful graphical representation of Unified Modeling Language class diagram to present a generic model of educational role playing games. This model uses knowledge representation (game elements, functionalities and features) to support designing educational role playing games. Fifty eight game developers participated in evaluating the model and they have revealed its high perceived usefulness while designing educational role playing games. In addition, they reported that they were willing to use this model again in the future in their context.},

abstract={A good mobile educational game should be developed using the right element of the game design as to give a positive impact to the user who use it for educational purposes. Designing an application that uses a mobile platform is not an easy thing to do. With the constraints on the size of the screen as well as the information that should be displayed, making the issue of the mobile educational design to be debated. Based on the multimedia development model that looks at the 3i design aspect of the interface, information and interaction, this paper discusses the findings of a mobile educational game focusing on "Permutation and Combination" topics for Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics subjects. For the completion of this research, PIE Model has been used throughout the process which consist of planning, Implementation and evaluation. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the educational mobile game design which will be analysed by using the 3i design factors. This study has been conducted by involving a total of 35 respondents from computer science student who follow the subject of Linear Algebra and discrete mathematics in their studies. Apart from that, questionnaires related to the 3i design factor had been distributed after respondents used the mobile educational games application.

This paper has investigated the evaluation phase and has focused on the provision of general heuristics sets to facilitate the evaluation process. A generic evaluation framework has been defined as an output of this paper which could be used in the majority of game genres, and therefore it can be an important part of generic game development methodology. Furthermore, this evaluation process has been repeated in each iteration of the game development methodology. The results from each iteration should be compared with previous iteration to enhance and improve games before the final game release.},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of gaming simulation as a research method in project management. Gaming simulation is used for identifying the impact of ambiguity and urgency on project participants' attitudes in the early phase. By ambiguity we mean lack of clarity of goals and objectives of the project. Urgency refers to time pressure, in the sense that the project has to be completed within specified time frame. The results of the experiments shows that ambiguity and urgency leads to three significant response patterns by the project participants 1) the tendency to overly focus on the technical solution, 2) the tendency to make unverified assumptions 3) significance rise to personal emotions, such as fear, diffidence, competitiveness and eagerness. The results obtained using gaming simulation as a research method are consistent with previously published studies. The paper concludes that gaming simulation can be used in project management research. Threats to validity and reliability can be controlled to a satisfactory level if the game design and configuration guarantee an adequate level of realism and insight.},

Firstly, we analyzed the factors that need to be considered for effectiveness of serious games to achieve student learning outcomes, engagement and motivation. Then, we reviewed the game design and development methodology or framework in the current literature. The review indicates that there is a limited systematic connection between learning theory and serious game development methodology. Majority of research studies focus on student motivation and engagement but only few studies focus on learning outcomes. Moreover, the motivation and engagement are measured manually rather than using real time tools. Additionally, the current serious games designs are mostly static in nature and need to incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning to make serious games dynamic to handle various scenarios.},

abstract={Game SAN is a simulation game of diagnosis of coronary artery using 99mTc-Tetrofosmin that developed as a media learning for grade XII high school students as a form of integration subjects of chemistry, physics, and biology. One of the most important part in the process of game development is the game interface design. The interface is an important part in the game that supports communication between users and the game. A good interface design will be able to produce ease, naturalness, and involves the interaction between user and system and allows users to do the jobs they need. The study focused on the design and implementation of visual interfaces of game SAN, with regard to the principles of good interface development in the form of simplicity, feedback, similarity, and familiarity. Visual interface that will be examined consists of four main components of a game interface, including the physical inputs, physical outputs, virtual interface, and the game world. Based on the results of testing the 17 respondents, aspects of usability from heuristics Nielsen shows that game SAN is flexible and efficient with enough categories (69.12%), aesthetic and minimalist design with good category (73.24%), help and documentation with good category (76.47%), and recognize than recall with good category (76.26%). Testing aspects of user experience shows that users feel satisfied, comfortable, and happy to use the SAN game with good category (80.88%).},

abstract={This paper presents the XML-based Video Game Description Language (XVGDL), a new language for specifying Video games which is based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The proposal is portable and extensible, and allows games to not only be defined at engine level but also includes specific features that can lead the game design process whilst simultaneously reducing the gap between game specification and its corresponding game implementation. XVGDL is as generic as possible, making it possible to describe different genres of games. This paper focuses on presenting the basis of the language. The paper describes the syntax as well as the components of XVGDL, and provides examples of their use. Defining games via XML structures provides all the advantages of the management of XML files and opens up interesting lines of research. Our proposal provides a number of novel features. So, XVGDL game definitions can be managed as any other XML file, which means that it can be automatically handled by any XML file management software. Another interesting feature is that XVGDL can specify game components (e.g., game Artificial), in-game processes (e.g., the procedural generation of maps) or in-game events (e.g., the checking of the conditions to end a game match) via the association with external (possibly non-XML) files. Moreover, XVGDL files can be easily validated as any XML file what means that validations against a particular Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) are possible. In addition, the paper presents a first prototype implementation of a (text-based) interpreter that allows XVGDL game specifications as a playable game to be executed. This tool not only validates our proposal but also represents a first step towards smoothing the path to obtaining an executable version of a game from its game specification.},

abstract={Dynamic strategies used by attackers to break down the software system calls for dynamic countermeasure selection techniques. A significant challenge in engineering self-proctoring software system is selecting a proper countermeasure while the software systems undergoes a well-planned attack. To address this challenge, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the software system as a two-player game. Modeling such interaction using game theory enables the decision-making engine to model the strategies of the attackers while considers the effect of possible defense strategies in a dynamic attack scenario. In this research work, we aim at engineering a novel decision-making framework that utilizes game theoretic techniques to select the proper mitigation against an attack. The introduced framework consists of three high-level phases including: modeling quality goal, designing game-theoretic techniques, and realizing the decision-making engine. The first phase models the security goals of the system and maps goal-oriented model to the designed game-theoretic technique. Such goal model makes the decision-making engine capable of tracking the satisfaction of modeled goals before and after applying a mitigation strategy. The framework provides the steps to map the goal-oriented model to any game-theoretic techniques that is suitable to model the countermeasure selection.},

abstract={Designing a (video) game such that it is balanced - i.e. fair for all players - is a prevailing challenge in game design. Perhaps counter-intuitively, games that are symmetric with respect to (board) design, starting conditions, and the employed action set, are not necessarily fair games. Indeed, perfect play from all players does not automatically lead to a draw, but may probabilistically favour e.g., the first player to move. Even more so, asymmetric games - in which the action set of one player is typically highly distinct from that of another player - are generally unbalanced unless meticulous care has been taken to ensure that the asymmetry in the design does not skew win probabilities. In this context, the present paper contributes a method for automatically balancing the design of asymmetric games. It employs Monte Carlo simulation to analyse the relative impact of game actions, and iteratively adjusts attributes of the game actions till the game design is balanced by approximation. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were performed with automatically balancing a set of tower-defence games. Preliminary experimental results revealed that the proposed method (1) is able to identify the principal component of a game's imbalance, and (2) can automatically adjust the game design till it is balanced by approximation.},

abstract={Bugs that persist into releases of video games can have negative impacts on both developers and users, but particular aspects of testing in game development can lead to difficulties in effectively catching these missed bugs. It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types. Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from greater attention in order to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our results in devising tools and methods to better identify and address certain bug types.},

abstract={Dengue is a global public health challenge. The dengue virus is transmitted mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also a vector of other diseases such as zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever. Its transmission dynamics is complex, involving several actors, factors and processes. Acting against vectors is still an important strategy, mainly due to limitations in efficacy and accessibility of vaccines. We believe that including and awareness of population is an important factor to address the problem. This project aims to design and develop a serious game to support actions and strategies based on prevention and epidemiological surveillance. In order to raise awareness about vector ecology and disease transmission dynamics, the game design presents information and seeks to encourage behavior changes in a playful environment. Moreover, gamification strategies are being used to stimulate concrete actions in real world. A mix of 2D-based game, augmented reality, virtual reality and the real world itself, will provide the proper environment to offer fun with the purpose of helping to deal with this complex problem. This paper presents the game design and current development stage. The artifacts are being developed in an iterative and incremental way, involving activities of conception, design, construction/prototyping and evaluation. Results include the game design, prototypes and the release of a demo version.},

abstract={There has long been a custom that game development is not the mainstream of engineering and its tardiness brings little or even no harm to this industry. Nowadays, the pendulum of industrial development has swung to another side. A game project may involve hundreds of developers, thousands of jobs, and millions of costs. Situations would be worse if jobs overlap with others. Any delay of a large game project can cause a heavy penalty. Consequently, in this study, we propose two scheduling algorithms to reduce the total tardiness of a game project. If the problem size is small, a branch-and-bound algorithm is employed to provide the optimal schedules; otherwise a genetic algorithm is used to generate near-optimal schedules. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms reduce the total tardiness significantly.},

abstract={General Video Game Playing (GVGP) has become a popular line of research in the past years, leading to the existence of a wide range of general algorithms created to tackle this challenge. This paper proposes taking advantage of this research to help in game design and testing processes. It introduces a methodology consisting of using a team of Artificial General Intelligence agents with differentiated goals (winning, exploring, collecting items, killing NPCs, etc.) and skill levels. Using several agents with distinct behaviours that play the same game simultaneously can provide substantial information to influence design and bug fixing. Two methods are proposed to aid game design: 1) the evaluation of a game based on the expected performance in the behaviour of each of the agents, and 2) the provision of visual information to analyse how the experience of the agents evolves during the play-through. Having this methodology available to designers can help them decide if the game or level under analysis fits the initial expectations. Including a Logging System can also be used to detect anomalies while the development is still at an early stage. We believe this approach allows the flexibility and portability to be easily applied to games with different characteristics.},

abstract={Gamification is a new technique in instructional design that gains more and more attention in the elearning field. The implementation of gamification systems varies on different fields, such as sales, web design, marketing, education etc. There are many examples of applied gamification, such as international companies that use game elements in their applications in order to increase the users' motivation through a gamified process. In this paper we outline the design of a gamified scenario with the use of structural and content gamification to increase student intrinsic motivation based on the Self-Determination Theory. Besides, the use of game elements, thus game-design techniques, make the learning process more “fun” and maintain the realistic purpose of its situation. However, the process of increasing motivation has a level of complexity, since rewards and other game elements trigger extrinsic motivation. As such this study investigates students' intrinsic motivation by designing and implementing an eClass through practical usage of gamification based on the core components of Self Determination Theory (SDT), so as to improve student engagement in class. According to the findings the use of gamification in learning and instructional design can improve student motivation. This gamified elearning course can be used as an instructional tool to increase the levels of motivation and achieve all the learning outcomes and goals with the higher success rate in online education. Further research is required to confirm these theoretical findings.},

abstract={There is an increasing interest in providing Computer Science (CS) instruction to a wider sector of the population. On the one hand, it would be convenient to include CS instruction in higher education beyond engineering disciplines, since CS has become a powerful catalyzer for development of society, and therefore the need for a workforce with solid CS background is growing. On the other hand, it would be beneficial to bring CS instruction to primary and secondary education, used as a vehicle to increase interest in CS and capture talent for STEM disciplines from early stages. However, successful delivery of CS instruction to a wide audience is a challenge. Game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment, since they have the power to appeal to wider audiences. In this paper we identify the need to find more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to variable levels of complexity and contents related to CS. We present a flexible and scalable game architecture, and a game model to create videogames for learning CS languages, along with a game engine developed as a reference implementation. The game model focuses on level-based games where the student has to introduce short text fragments or programs to solve each of the levels. This game model is consistent to others found in the literature (Scratch, Logo, etc.) that have proven it effective, since it allow students to discover programming in a self-exploratory way, using their own intuition and learning from their mistakes. Our approach is scalable because (1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design, allowing reusing the games with different CS markup or programming languages; and (2) it provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. The approach was tested by developing "Lost in space", an educational game for learning XML. In this game, students control a spaceship, and their goal is to reach a safe point in each of the levels. They provide instructions to the ship with short programs that they write using XML-based instructions. At the beginning students can use a small set of instructions. As they master these types of instructions, new ones become available, supporting in this manner scaffolded learning. The game was tested with undergraduate students from computer science and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e. lecture). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude along the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain observed with the game-based instructional approach, even effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction. We think that our approach is adequate to introduce CS languages in general, as well as new programming languages.},

abstract={Software process modeling (SPM) is an important area of software engineering because it provides a basis for managing, automating, and supporting software process improvement (SPI). Teaching SPM is a challenging task, mainly because it lays great emphasis on theory and offers few practical exercises. Furthermore, as yet few teaching approaches have aimed at teaching SPM by introducing innovative features, such as games. The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS.BR). The results indicate that playing the game can have a positive learning effect and results in a greater degree of learning effectiveness than does the project-based learning instructional method.},

These challenges are partially explained by practitioners' lack of motivation to apply agile techniques in practice. Some researchers have already proposed to tackle this problem with gamification, i.e. the use of game elements and game-design in non-game contexts. However, very few gamification proposals were evaluated with Scrum teams in practice. In this paper, we present a software tool based on gamification to make Scrum techniques more fun and engaging for practitioners. As a result, practitioners should increase their motivation to apply Scrum techniques in practice, which in turn might result in more and better software. This paper describes the first iteration of a larger research effort that follows the Design Science Research methodology. In this first research iteration, a prototype was developed, and a project team is currently using the prototype to evaluate the real impact of gamification on Scrum adoption in a real-world organization.},

abstract={The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. The systematic mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games, gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that "Software Process", "Software Design" and "Profession Practice" are the most recurring knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education. We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods.},

abstract={As a popular way of entertainment, game has played an important role in our daily life, and more and more people have dreams to design some kinds of games by themselves. Thanks to the emergence of game engine, people's dreams come into reality. With the help of game engine, designing a game becomes easier, and the development time is also reduced considerably. This paper introduces an education-oriented game engine, named logical animation platform. The features of logical animation platform are presented, and the basic development process to design a game is summed up. The design process of an aircraft game is given as an example to demonstrate how to use the logical animation platform to develop games, and to show the advantages of the game engine. Finally, the future of the logical animation platform and game development are outlined.},

abstract={Function Points (FP) method has been trusty and proven to be effective to estimate the effort of thousands of software development projects. Nowadays, the mobile game development-especially in a casual genre-is growing. Therefore, the researcher is excited to test the FP method whether it can also be applied to estimating the game development effort. FP method usually consists of 3 main stages: weighing 5 parameters of Unadjusted FP, calculating 14 complexity factors, and calculating Adjusted FP. Survey to 8 casual games was conducted and the value of effort for each one of them has been estimated. So, we conclude that FP is not suitable to forecast the effort of mobile casual games. There are 376 percent deviation between effort estimations and actual effort. The authors suspect, for mobile game development, the game's point of view needs to be re-adjusted to 5 input parameters, complexity factors, conversion of programming languages, and productivity rate.},

In this paper, the initial work towards developing such a tool is presented. It focuses on the extraction of learning curves from single-player, deterministic, turn-based (puzzle) games. Learning curves in such games can be directly associated with their gameplay quality. The extraction is done by training a number of varying size, feed-forward neural networks on the game transition model. The main contribution of the work is the introduction of learning curve based puzzle game design concepts and their practical examples along with a quantitative method for learning curve estimation.},

abstract={This paper describes the early stages of an experiment investigating the role of the computer as a creative collaborator in the game design process. We introduce the Shibumi set, a closed game system so simple that its rule space can be completely defined, yet deep enough to allow interesting games to emerge. Constraining the search space to such a closed system has computational benefits, but had unexpected effects on the creative process of designers during a related game design contest. These effects yield some insight into the creative process of experienced game designers, in particular, the way they search for rule sets to realise desired behaviours, and suggest a simple unified model of the game design process. We suggest ways in which these insights may be incorporated into future work, to produce software that might not only search for new games more effectively and assist the designer as a creative collaborator, but to automate the game design process in ways that might be perceived as more creative.},

abstract={Both board games and animations have been used as learning tools for various disciplines in many universities. Students have sometimes been assessed for their learning outcome in subjects where they enroll by participating in playing the board games or watching the animations. Nonetheless, not many will seek students to create the games or animations. On the other hand, Information Security (InfoSec), audit and control, as well as risk management are traditional disciplines where games and animations were rarely introduced. A study was undertaken to induce senior undergraduate students to design board games or to create animations as part of the assessment, in a subject of Information System Audit and Control. One motivation is to validate whether students who chose the said options for group project may have a better learning experience than other students who chose the traditional assessment method. The research also tries to explore the possible adoption of board games and animations as part of the subject assessment. We included both game design and animation design as group project options. After the completion of the project, we invited the students, lecturers of other courses and professionals from the industry to comment on our alternative options of the group project. Our results indicated students had a better project experience and learning climate when designing board games or animations for their project, while the preliminary feedback from the industry and other academics are both positive in general.},

abstract={The recently emerged field of game analytics and the development and adaptation of business intelligence techniques to support game design and development has given data-driven techniques a direct role in game development. Given that all digital games contain some sort of spatial operation, techniques for spatial analysis had their share in these developments. However, the methods for analyzing and visualizing spatial and spatio-temporal patterns in player behavior being used by the game industry are not as diverse as the range of techniques utilized in game research, leaving room for a continuing development. This paper presents a review of current work on spatial and spatio-temporal game analytics across industry and research, describing and defining the key terminology, outlining current techniques and their application. We summarize the current problems and challenges in the field, and present four key areas of spatial and spatio-temporal analytics: Spatial Outlier Detection, Spatial Clustering, Spatial Predictive Models, Spatial Pattern and Rule Mining. All key areas are well-established outside the context of games and hold the potential to reshape the research roadmap in game analytics.},

A meta-model facilitates the development of high-quality, engaging, educational games because it explicitly ties knowledge requirements, transferable skills and course outcomes to game production. Our meta-model is designed to be transferable across curricula, as it modularizes domain specific bodies of knowledge (BOK), a learning taxonomy (e.g., Bloom's), and skill based challenges. The model situates learning opportunities in a plotline wherein the student-player advances by succeeding against non-player adversaries. Knowledge-based challenges framed by a learning taxonomy develop the transferable skills required by international accreditation standards and provide feedback to both the player and the faculty member. Situating assessment challenges in an immersive game environment makes them more engaging and imaginative than typical on-line tests or assignments.

Success or failure of any project can be attributed incorrect handling of one or more project variables: people, proper technology, proper project scheduling and selection. Among these attributes proper project selection is one of the most vital part of software project management. There exist many uncertainties in project management and current software engineering techniques are unable to eliminate them. So there is huge scope for developing. The current researchers have developed a unique model which is capable to take decision on the field of software project selection. This model has two embedded sub models namely fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and strategic game model. Here in the first case experts opinions are considered under fuzzy environment and in the second case, different decisions makers act as players in the game module. Different criteria are taken into consideration for choosing optimal strategy of the players. An elaborated case study is also analyzed for testing the output of the system.},

abstract={This paper presents and evaluates a new educational tool and a model for learning theory and practice of game development, by involving geographically separated and culturally different industrial and academic organizations. We propose a TRIAD education model, which is as an extension to the conventional project-based learning, by uniting industry staff, faculty members, and students in an online discussion space. This model is a two-phase cyclic model where in Phase-1) industry members and academic staff discuss the progress of PBL transparently, showing the cross-cultural gaps and advising how to solve them, and in Phase-2) students make progress on the projects. Additionally, the TRIAD model adopts asynchronous text messaging as a core communication method, which is suitable for a multi-timezone situation, as well as exchanges of self-reviews from students and feedback from instructors. The online space not only facilitates interns in overcoming the hurdles represented by the gaps between the industry and academia, but it also visualizes the students' implicit educational progress by periodically analyzing all stored data by applying quantitative text analysis methods. This paper shows the result of an empirical study by utilizing this TRIAD model and analytics tool conducted at a large-scale Japanese game company with over 2,000 employees focusing on two students from the division of game development at a university in Sweden. We applied a quantitative text analysis tool for this model during an on-going internship program to clarify how students change their thoughts and behaviors by acquiring cross-cultural professionalism in the game industry. In addition, the result indicates that this TRIAD model is resilient, even under the COVID-19 epidemic situation due to its text-based approach.},

abstract={Research full paper: The Norwegian government encourages higher education institutions to improve education when it comes to active learning, and in their programme for student-active learning, involving students in research is one of the specified areas of interest. This project is an action research approach to improve research-like learning methods in a higher education course. The paper presents experiences from using a research method as a learning method, more specifically using a systematic literature review to learn about the research method game analysis. The findings show that the students are active and engaged when using a research method as a learning method, but that the learning outcome is rather on the learning method than the primary learning objective. A systematic literature review also works as a learning method because it is well-defined with specified steps of action, which works as scaffolding in a learning process. The teachers' role is important when involving students in parts of a research process, and it is important to consider which stages of the research process the teacher should prepare and in which stages to involve the students. The study also revealed that there is a need for a better definition of game analysis as a research method, with clearly defined "how to"-guidelines for inexperienced researchers and students doing a bachelor project or master project, which can allow inexperienced game development students to also use game analysis as a research method.},

abstract={Procedural content generation is generally viewed as a means to an end-a tool employed by designers to overcome technical problems or achieve a particular design goal. When we move from generating single parts of games to automating the entirety of their design, however, we find ourselves facing a far wider and more interesting set of problems than mere generation. When the designer of a game is a piece of software, we face questions about what it means to be a designer, about computational creativity, and about how to assess the growth of these automated game designers and the value of their output. Answering these questions can lead to new ideas in how to generate content procedurally, and produce systems that can further the cutting edge of game design. This paper describes work done to take an automated game designer and advance it towards being a member of a creative community. We outline extensions made to the system to give it more autonomy and creative independence, in order to strengthen claims that the software is acting creatively. We describe and reflect upon the software's participation in the games community, including entering two game development contests, and show the opportunities and difficulties of such engagement. We consider methods for evaluating automated game designers as creative entities, and underline the need for automated game design to be a major frontier in future games research.},

Many of the traditional practices in the design and development of Graphical User Interfaces do not fit the context of Virtual Reality (VR), requiring adaptations or the creation of new solutions. This work proposes to analyze some of the GUI guidelines for VR, and from this, investigate the perception of players about the GUI guidelines. An analysis of some of the manufacturers and game engine guidelines for VR was carried out with the purpose of identifying which recommendations are more common. After that, a survey was applied with players to define, from the perspective of the user, the level of importance of each guideline. In addition to the analysis of the users' perspective, a set of games has been chosen and analyzed to understand the game's compliance with the guidelines. The results of the analysis showed that the games are respecting the guidelines, but users still perceive some issues with the VR games GUIs.},

abstract={Because the present university sports teaching lacks the concrete application of humanistic education teaching mode, so it put forward that the game theory is used in sports teaching in Colleges and Universities, by using the participants, behavior, information, strategy and so on, the basic concept of the game theory to design teaching methods, teaching contents and evaluation methods. Then turning the sports teaching process into the process of the game theory and practice, and the teacher should guide the students actively participate in the game of ball games to improve the students' participation, competition ability, communicating with people, work ability, and good at the game, management ability, giving full play to the prominent role of physical education of the game features, effectively improving the humanistic quality, to provide a reference for the PE teaching reform in Colleges and universities' sports curriculum.},

abstract={In chapter 4, I posed the question why the type of artificial intelligence methods we have seen so many examples of in this book are not used more in games. I outlined a couple of potential reasons for this. One of the reasons I mentioned is that game development is a surprisingly risk-averse industry because of the hit-driven nature of the business and that the technology may not be mature enough yet. Now, after spending the past few chapters on AI methods for playing games, modeling players, and generating content, we'll revisit the question. This time we focus on the role of game design in enabling AI and, conversely, AI in enabling game design.},

abstract={Hands-on training is considered one of the major requirements for most of Computer Science curriculum; some courses mandate lab components, while other courses do not require it. Students' learning outcomes are usually enhanced by “doing” rather than simply reading or attending lectures, therefore skills acquired by projects and hands-on training are a must have for the job market. This paper shows by experiments that students' learning outside classroom using a hands-on project. Students experienced first-hand how to work on team to achieve one goal of engineering and design a Video Game Level design. Level design is the process of creating levels for a video game. Level design process is usually split up among a group of designers. A level designer is a crucial member to a video game development team. Level design team responsible of creating the world that the player is put into. The design process consists of 4 phases: the idea on paper, hammering the level, testing the product, and back to the drawing board phase. There are several concepts should be taken into consideration during the design process; geography, sound and lighting concepts are highlighted and considered. The most important finding from this research is; group based project even if it is not part of a formal course offering using an attractive method, like game level design, can be of a great impact on students learning and skill building.},

In this vein, the design elements in assistive SGs for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients are explored here. The Game-Based Learning (GBL) design framework is adopted and its main game-design parameters are combined in a test case of Exergames design, drawn from the i-PROGNOSIS Personalized Game Suite (http://www.i-prognosis.eu). Data from a GBL-related Web-survey, completed by 104 participants, were subjected to linear regression analysis, so to identify an adapted GBL framework with the most significant game-design parameters, which efficiently predict the transferability of the Exergames beneficial effect to real-life, addressing functional PD symptoms. The findings of the proposed analysis can assist game designers to focus on the use of significant parameters during the designing process of Exergames for PD patients and maximize the positive effect of the SGs in their quality of daily life.},

Specifically, we present the development of two game versions. First prototype was created without a third party game engine and it led to many challenges. To explore solutions to these challenges, we created a new version of game with the Unity 3D game engine. Using the Unity 3D, the game development process was simplified. A mixed-method usability evaluation on children and university students indicated that especially interaction with AR content and user interface clarity were improved in the Unity 3D version. This study produced three important contributions: 1) a novel mobile AR exergame to motivate children to move; 2) reimplementation of the game using the Unity 3D; and 3) results of a usability evaluation comparing two game versions. We expect that game engines such as the Unity 3D will become essential for AR game development in the future.},

abstract={The use of serious games in a wide variety of educational settings is gaining popularity, given their ability to engage and motivate learners - particularly the current generation, who have grown up regularly playing video games. However, despite the current “buzz” surrounding serious games, there are many bad examples; this has been attributed to developers supplanting game design without adequate attention to proper instructional design. Given the importance of instructional design, we have developed a tutorial (“minicourse”) that, combines “hands-on” activities and didactic instruction to emphasizes its role in the development and evaluation of serious games. By outlining the developmental process of several example serious games for health professions education, the tutorial also emphasizes the inherent interdisciplinary nature of serious games design and potential issues that may arise when an interdisciplinary team embarks on such a project. Here, we describe the tutorial by providing greater details regarding the “hands-on” activities, the material covered within the tutorial, and attendee perceptions regarding serious games before and after the tutorial. Our goal is to bring awareness to the importance of ensuring a balance between game design and instructional design when developing serious games.},

abstract={Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.},

abstract={Involving consumers as influencers of the video game development process is the main feature of Steam's early access model. This has led to the exponential increase in the popularity of Steam's early access games. Steam being the most widespread digital distribution platform for video games on computers is part of the reason for the success of the early access model. Another part is the abundance of possibilities for game developers to communicate with end users and vice versa. The model is considered a success by the game development community as numerous games using Steam's early access as their distribution platform have gained a large user base (game owners) and high sales, even though, on principle early access games are not complete and are offered for sale in alpha and beta stages with no guarantees on release date or development schedule. Hence, the success of such a model cannot just be measured with owner and sale numbers. This paper aims to explore the interconnection between employing Steam's early access model and the satisfaction of consumers.},

abstract={Game development is commonly seen as a collaborative effort, with teams cooperating on the same project. Nowadays, a variety of cloud-based services have shown the benefits of performing tasks in real-time collaboration with others. In this article, we present a system for collaborative game level editing. We model this problem as a special instance of merging labeled directed acyclic graphs. We propose an algorithm that guarantees that the shared game level is always coherent between edits, both hierarchically and semantically. We establish real-time collaboration by initiating merges automatically and by augmenting the game editor interface to allow users to monitor all others edits in real time. We validate our algorithm by merging complex edits and large game levels. We further validate the collaborative workflow by running a user study with expert game developers, showing that our system works well and collaborative workflows are beneficial to game development.},

In this paper, we consider video game development in the open source system (OSS) context. Specifically, we investigate how developers contribute to video games vs. non-games by working on different kinds of artifacts, how they handle malfunctions, and how they perceive the development process of their projects. To this purpose, we conducted a mixed, qualitative and quantitative study on a broad suite of 60 OSS projects. Our results confirm the existence of significant differences between game and non-game development, in terms of how project resources are organized and in the diversity of developers' specializations. Moreover, game developers responding to our survey perceive more difficulties than other developers when reusing code as well as performing automated testing, and they lack a clear overview of their system's requirements.},

abstract={Designing audio games is a complex challenge that differs from video game design as they feature no visual output. For this reason a number of researchers conceived specific audio game design rules geared towards working with sound. In this paper, we provide complementing audio game anti rules that we collated from an extensive review process involving 157 audio game prototypes by interaction design students. We argue why anti rules can be a powerful means in preventing common mistakes in audio game design. In more detail, we present eleven anti rules which when followed are likely to spoil the user experience of an audio game. Hence, the approach in this paper is not to state what should be done (verified design guidelines), but to inform the designer which features will probably ruin an audio game (falsify the hypothesis or probability that it will be good and enjoyable).},

The best serious games are simulations that have the appearance of a game, but whose events and / or processes are non-game. Usually they include business domains and military operations (many games are popular entertainment on the basis of business and military operations, but with simpler rules). On the other hand, one of the purposes of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering is the creation of methodologies and tools that enable inexpensive development and maintenance of agent-based software. The relationship between serious games and Agent-Oriented Software Engineering is also clear given that software agents (perhaps intelligent) are used as virtual players or actors in many computer games and simulations, that the agent paradigm is of great interest in social behavior and interaction among agents (that can be thought of as players in a game), and also that the development process for agents is very close to the process of game development.},

abstract={The complexity of balancing educational purpose and engaging gameplay mechanics through appropriate design decisions has frequently been discussed in learning game literature. The discussion has primarily focused on highlighting connections between game design principles and learning principles and making guidelines for achieving engaging learning scenarios through game mechanics tailored to specific subject matters. Play, and the learning derived from it, is thus often studied as a phenomenon of the two disparate forces of education and gameplay colliding inside a closed system. The complexity of designing games for educational purposes is subsequently also seen as a product of the dichotomies between these two forces. However, the discussions on the design of learning games and their potential as learning tools seldom take the practicalities of formal educational environments into consideration. In this paper, learning game design principles are investigated alongside developers' and educators' working practices. In our analysis we identify and examine a set of issues that complicate learning game design and development. The primary conclusion of this research is that the contexts in which learning games are used significantly alter the way they can be played by introducing constraints as well as facilitating conditions to the play sessions. The paper concludes with an argument for a shift of attention from the product centric view of today to a view that takes pedagogical contexts and organizational values into better account.},

abstract={Serious educational games are specially designed computer games which are used in an educational setting, in other words, they are interactive competitive lessons with defined learning outcomes which allow students to have fun during learning. The importance of serious games in contemporary educational practice is increasing. Applying serious games in teaching, students facilitate the learning process, adopt new skills and abilities, show more interest in learning, are more focused and more active in a class, and better understand and apply lessons learned. The complexity of serious games requires large efforts for their development. For the development of serious games teachers mostly use commercial game engines. One of the important parts of game development is a selection of appropriate development tool. Due to the range of available tools the choice of platforms for serious games is a challenge, whose selection often has considerably different goals and technical requirements depending on context and usage. The aim of this paper is to propose criteria which should be considered before selecting a game engine for serious games and shows results of a comparison of evaluated most popular game engines. Some recommendations for teachers about choosing the most suitable game engines for serious games development are also presented.},

abstract={Game is one kind of attractions that exist in local rural communities. In Bali, traditionally, there are various types of games played by children and adults. The Balinese traditional games such as tajog, gangsing, petaumpet, etc. can be found in particular villages. Not only games, Bali also has various kinds of folklores or legends, known for generations, namely Jayaprana, I Rajapala, etc. The folklores and legends had not been much developed in the form of ICT-based game. In this case, a very interesting folklore was told and developed in the form of a game. The aim of the game development was to introduce and preserve Balinese local wisdom. The folklore of Balinese culture that was developed was “I Rajapala as a Hunter”. The method used in developing the game was a method of waterfall. Limited test results showed that it was technically able to be run as the game designs: (1) There are three missions of the game: shooting 3 pigs or birds, finding a place to rest, and hiding one of the angel' s shawls; (2) The difficulty level of the game consists of three levels: easy, medium, and hard to complete the three missions of the game. The results of limited application tests showed that 93.4% (3 stars) of players could complete the game mission, while the remaining 6.6% (2 stars) failed to complete the 3 game missions. The benefit gained by the players is knowing the story of I Rajapala as a Balinese cultural heritage.},

abstract={In Requirements Engineering (RE) for large scale game systems, play-testing is an important activity that is used to validate requirements from players' perspective. Play-testers are not professionals that are involved in the process of RE. They are not professional testers, either. Yet, their feedback in terms of perceptions and experiences of the early prototypes of a game, have a decisive impact on what the RE-professionals do next in the RE process. This position paper presents a qualitative study that sought to discover who takes the role of play-testers and what kind of feedback play-testers generate in the early stages of RE for games. The case study responds to the observation that no textbook on RE or software engineering addresses play-testing as a phenomenon, and that classic Computer Science programs at universities teach testing techniques mostly in the context of embedded systems, hence students often are left with little opportunity to develop testing skills that build upon play-testing practices happening in the game development sector. The study therefore was aimed at identifying important implications that play-testing may have for research and teaching.},

One possible approach presents our intensive course on agile software development, applying games in engineering education, within the framework of a one-week pan-European exchange program. First, we briefly introduce the program that's held twice a year, offering about 60 scientific intensive courses in each session. Topics come from the research fields at the partner institutions and focus on engineering, natural sciences, and mathematics. Roughly 4,000 students from 24 universities in 15 European countries participate in the program annually. Second, we report on the concept and design of our intensive course on agile software development. We apply a flipped classroom setting to acquire the basic knowledge; we use game-based learning for in-class exercises; we foster project-based and collaborative learning for practical implementation. Finally, we outline the project work in our course and share the most inspiring student projects diving into data-driven visualizations and learning analytics. Thus, the participants gain insights into the real-life application of agile project management methods and international collaboration in heterogeneous teams despite the limited course length.},

abstract={We study an online game supply chain that is composed of a game developer and a distributor. We investigate the impact of the distributor sharing demand information on the game quality investment during the game development stage and the marketing investment. Our analyses show that information sharing does not always improve marketing investment. When the online game market demand is relatively insensitive to the game price, sharing information motivates the distributor to invest more in marketing. In addition, information sharing always affects the developer's decision in product quality. The developer will be less conservative in product quality when it is more certain about the market demand and commit a higher investment after having demand information shared with it. For the distributor, we find that information sharing only results in a higher markup decision when the market demand is not very sensitive to the game price. There exists a Pareto improvement region so that the distributor will voluntarily share the demand information, which benefits both supply chain members.},

abstract={Serious games are considered as powerful tools in learning and instructional purpose. Besides that, serious game also gains its own popularity among children and adolescence. Given the wide popularity of serious game, therapists realize the advantages of using games as the assistive tool in psychotherapy so called therapeutic game. However, the lack of available comprehensive guideline for design and development of therapeutic game is still a barrier to the game developers to produce a high quality therapeutic game. Henceforward, this research aims to propose a design model by integrating core elements of selected therapeutic approach that is cognitive behavior therapy. The main issue in psychotherapy is engagement of adolescents into psychotherapy. To address this problem, the proposed model also integrates player experience as the essential element, which is highly related with engagement. The proposed model is derived from a comparative study of ten game design models.},

Game developers must know how the market is going to be able to reap huge profits. By knowing the market situation, game developers can also determine whether the games made are in accordance with market conditions. Getting this information is not easy, especially for small game studios. In this research, we made a new application to find knowledge about games that are and will be trending. We used data mining is used to obtain this information. Data mining uses data from the Steam API to do clustering using the Hierarchical K-Means method and predictive using the Multiple Linear Regression method. The use of the Hierarchical K-Means method produces 3 clusters for the game's popularity level. The use of the Multiple Linear Regression method produces predictions of the game's popularity in the future. This new system will be able to help indie game studios to be able to obtain information about the condition of the gaming market thereby increasing the benefits that can be obtained.},

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in developing embodied conversational agents (ECA) with multimodal interfaces [2]. Among multimodal interfaces, natural language processing is most promising techniques in commercial game development side. Traditionally in game industry, communication between player and virtual agent in game was conducted by selecting player's replay among 2~3 candidate sentences. But recent advances in natural language process enable player's sentence input in interactive drama game [3]. In this paper, we propose interactive chatting game based on sentiment analysis of player's input sentence. In order to understand player's emotions, we construct web-query based sentiment databases, and uses it with similarity ccomparison method. Our result could show that emergent narrative enables re-playable experience with natural language process technique in commercial online game.},

abstract={Disseminating scientific findings through journal publications is the very nature of every academic discipline. However, with the emergence of knowledge society and lifelong learning needs, there is a growing demand for alternative ways to enhance the dissemination of research findings to a broader audience than academics and young students. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of serious games as a well-acknowledged alternative method to discourse and delivering current engineering or management-related research findings to society. Then, considering the lack of a unified serious game design framework and the gaps in the extant literature, we illustrate our design rationale for the development and evaluation of serious games. The proposed framework contributes the following advancements to the body of extant literature and practices. It is strongly centered on a well-known knowledge transfer framework, and it is strongly based on a participatory design approach deliberately involving iterative and frequent testing and fine-tuning sessions that overcome the inherent limitations of traditional stage-gate or waterfall development models. We conclude by providing some insights gained during the development of the game and the framework, as well as by discussing the challenges associated with the design and use of serious games as an alternative genre for disseminating engineering- and management-related research findings.},

abstract={Motivation plays in important role in rehabilitation after stroke. Multi-modal games can provide an engaging and interactive platform to motivate people to actively participate in the therapy. Designing games for rehabilitation requires input from both multiple stakeholders such as the medical, bioengineering and game design fields. In order to bridge this gap, we implemented and tested games specifically designed for upper limb rehabilitation and observed their effects on players. This paper presents the design process for three rehabilitation games and their effects on motivation of a single stroke patient. These results indicate that engagement and enjoyment vary for the three different games while managing to achieve repetitive number of hand and wrist gestures in the background. In our summative evaluation planned to be conducted in patients' homes, 9 different games, including the three presented here, are provided to allow for providing a better range and a wider choice. Use-logs as well as the questionnaire trialed in this study will be used to assess preference and motivation, and to explore if current feedback will be repeated by a larger number of stroke patients and a wider range of impairments and preferences. These will further inform the process of game design for rehabilitation and personal well-being.},

abstract={This paper mainly study the decision-making model on the concession term for pure public welfare project in the concession management process. The traditional pure public welfare project always adopted the single government supplying mode which can easily cause the lack of predominant investor and make the incentive and obligatory mechanism invalid. Eventually this may lead to the low efficiency of the project management. Learning from BOT financing mode, introducing concession management mode into pure public welfare project can not only absorb the diversified predominant investors who may bring about competition, but also solve the problem of fund shortage. Because the pure public welfare project doesn't satisfy the conditions for charge and can't generate future cash flow, its concession management mode also has some differences with BOT projects'. This paper mainly studies the pure public welfare project which doesn't have cash income. After analyzing the characteristics of the pure public welfare project concession management mode, the paper establishes the game model on government and the project enterprise, discusses the relationship between concession term, construction cost of the project enterprise, compensation fees and so on, gets a decision-making model of the concession term and a calculation formula of construction cost which has been proved by empirical example. This model provides a concession term determination method of the pure public welfare project in its concession management process and has great theoretical value and practical application value.},

abstract={Background: The research on the use of serious games to provide learning of skills to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased in recent years. The use of serious games to provide vocabulary learning to children with ASD is still in infancy stage. Serious games are designed using a framework as a basis to use components in the game. However, there is no existing serious game design framework that can consider the needs of children with ASD.Objective: The objective of this study is to review components that could be useful in the design of serious game for children with ASD to learn vocabulary.Methods: The review of the literature on vocabulary learning of children with ASD and existing SGDFs was carried out to identify the components. The components have been reviewed from the perspective of 1) vocabulary learning of children with ASD in particular, 2) children with ASD in whole, 3) typical children and 4) game design in general.Results: A total of fifty components were found. The four components namely autism behaviours, strategies, instruction methods and modalities are related to children with ASD and their learning of vocabulary. The remaining components are based on the review of existing SGDFs. There were similarities in terms of use of components across the frameworks.Conclusion: The analysis of these components in the serious games developed for children with ASD shows its usability in designing games for these children.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, current research has yet to produce a result that has surpassed human-level performance in modern complex fighting games. This is due to the inherent difficulties with real-time fighting games, including: vast action spaces, action dependencies, and imperfect information. We overcame these challenges and made 1v1 battle AI agents for the commercial game "Blade & Soul". The trained agents competed against five professional gamers and achieved a win rate of 62%. This paper presents a practical reinforcement learning method that includes a novel self-play curriculum and data skip-ping techniques. Through the curriculum, three different styles of agents were created by reward shaping and were trained against each other. Additionally, this paper suggests data skipping techniques that could increase data efficiency and facilitate explorations in vast spaces. Since our method can be generally applied to all two-player competitive games with vast action spaces, we anticipate its application to game development including level design and automated balancing.},

abstract={Due to the outsourcing of many low level computing jobs, many students have a perception that there are very few computer science related jobs in the United States. Consequently, the number of students majoring in computer science has been decreasing. This project attempts to use social media as a means of attracting more students to study computer science and software engineering by exposing 16 to 20 year old students opportunities to the soft skills associated project management without being concerned about programming implementation details. It is an expectation that using a game setting to expose potential students to the rich set of activities that make up software engineering process may attract them to the consider the field as a course of study. An explicit goal of this project is to try to attract female students to the study of STEM coursework although the game is being designed to appeal to male students as well. It is also hoped to determine which types of engineering process activities are most attractive to female students. A prototype of proposed game will be completed during the summer of 2011.},

abstract={The rapid growth in the development of mobile games to serve various user needs has result in a high competition of software game development industry. Usability is a major quality of mobile game product which significantly affects the player satisfaction. The usability assessment of mobile game product which is game prototype developed during the production is result from the need of correction in an earlier stage which may help reduction in cost and time development. This research proposes an approach to define an internal usability quality metric for a mobile game prototype developed in a design phase. The proposed metric, classified from software attributes as content, device, and gameplay is defined based on the general suggested usability metric category in ISO/IEC 9126-3 standard and derived from GQM method (Goal Question Metrics). The structure and elements of the metric description are established from the ISO/IEC 15939 standard.},

Researchers have demonstrated that games have the potential for creating learning environments toward the improved attainment of educational and training goals. Suitable, clear and easy-to-follow guidelines need to be implemented, especially for the creation of e-learning games for children, to increase the expected benefits of game-based learning (GBL). In this paper, a comprehensive set of guidelines is proposed along with a detailed explanation of each guideline. The proposed set of GBL guidelines can be used with an expert evaluation method to identify possible problems in learning objectives, game designs, user interfaces, and child requirements in the early phases of a game project. This set of guidelines, though mainly targeted at the pre-production of a GBL, can be utilized in post-production phases.},

abstract={Serious games are a promising approach for demand-side management that aims to higher user engagement and active participation. In this paper, we introduce the problem of optimal serious-game design for achieving specific energy-consumption reduction goals. We consider a serious game, where a serious-game designer entity presents publicly to all consumers a list of top-K consumers and a list of bottom-M consumers according to their respective energy-consumption reduction at peak hours. The driving forces of this serious game are the user discomfort due to demand load reduction, the user desire for social approval and the user sensitivity to social outcasting. We formulate the problems of the serious-game designer as an operational-cost minimization one for the utility company and that of each consumer as a utility-maximization one. The serious-game-design problem is to decide on K, M and on the feedback provided to the consumers, while the consumer-side problem amounts to selecting the behavioral change to energy consumption that maximizes the expected user utility. By a series of simulations, we show how the choices of K, M affect the energy consumption reduction for different types of customers.},

abstract={This paper discusses approaches to teaching parts of the foundations of interactive narrative for the design of interactive media and games in a course offered to undergraduate New Media and Game Design students. The course is offered to upper division students, most of whom are in the Game Design degree in the School of Interactive Games and Media at the Rochester Institute of Technology. While traditional approaches to understanding narrative structure and analysis, grounded in theories of drama, myth and cinema, such as Aristotle's Poetics and Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces, are valuable and it is important for students to be familiar with this body of thought and practice, a growing body of empirical research and theory can help us understand the neurological basis for cognition, interaction design and narrative structure. Rather than viewing framing and metaphors as purely cinematic or poetic devices, for example, we can understand how they represent the encoding and representation of knowledge and a mechanism for automaticity in comprehension. These theories also provide a framework for analysis of media and interaction and a growing set of tools for designing user experience by basing our analytical and design tools and methodologies more firmly on empirical research. For example, how does one translate fairly abstract ideas and emotions into the procedural mechanics of the underlying systems upon which we implement interaction designs? Do we have predictive models that facilitate our ability to conduct research related to the design, implementation and effects of interactive media and games? As a beneficial side effect, learning about the power and automaticity of these cognitive processes might also help inoculate both students and faculty against the abusive use of neuroscience as it is incorporated into games, marketing, public relations and political propaganda. The paper will look application of the theories of frames and metaphors by Goffman [1], Fillmore [2] and Lakoff & Johnson [3].},

abstract={3D applications have travelled great lengths over the past few years as users are more accustomed towards visual environment and interactive media such as 3D games. One of the major concerns of 3D mobile game development is to provide interactive source of entertainment. Testing a 3D gaming is more complex and subjective then general mobile applications. A bug in general mobile application can be compromised in its first release but this might not work for a 2D or 3D gaming application. Any deficit in performance, graphics, logic and compatibility is simply rejected in the current saturated market. The testing approaches used for 3D visualization applications are either manual based or using automated testing tools, although one needs to be fully equipped with the domain knowledge and working of the automated tool for it to be useful. In this paper, we have proposed an adaptive usage based statistical testing (A-UBST) that adapts with the user experiences. This technique enables the quality engineers and testers to focus on the frequently accessed parts of SUT (software under test). We have used Markov Models to represent usage models. We demonstrated our approach with respect to 3D game. Our comparison results show the suitability of the approach for 3D gaming applications by reducing testing effort, time and cost metrics.},

In this paper, we present methods, and the implementation of those methods, for serious game design that accommodates the integration of game mechanics with learning. The focuses on narrative-learning synthesis, supplementing the player's actions with feedback, and the development of a sufficient guidance system without compromising the entertainment or education aspects of a game are presented.

One of the benefits of EGDA is that anyone can apply it to develop a game since it keeps development as simple as possible and uses tools for modeling and implementation that do not require a highly technical profile. EGDA has been applied to the creation of seven educational games in healthcare, and has been iteratively refined after each experience. EGDA is evaluated on two aspects. First, the effort and cost needed for creating these games is estimated and compared to current industry standards. Second, impact on knowledge acquisition and a student acceptance are discussed. Results suggest that EGDA can make game development more affordable, which is critical for increased adoption and scalability of game-based learning (GBL), while assuring a high educational value of the resulting games.},

abstract={An educational computer game was created in a research project where new teaching methods for information technology were developed. The game development project was a co-creative process involving both skilled information technology students and students with low information technology skills. Students with low information technology skills participated in the game development by writing gamified nonlinear stories that were integrated into the 3d game. Nonlinear stories are special type of stories where hyperlinks are used to connect parts of the story. Special software is often used to write nonlinear stories to make hyperlinking easier and to enable organizing the storyline structure. Here we use an open source storytelling software Twine. Nonlinear stories written with Twine were collected in a pilot study. These stories and the process of writing nonlinear stories were analyzed. It was noted that the software is more suitable for single users than collaborative work. Lack of easy-to-use options for sharing and remixing stories and difficulty in collaboration in story writing affected negatively to classroom activities. Social media integration for the story writing tool were designed and implemented to improve the potential for classroom adoption. Possible future use of the method is discussed.},

Each of these tools streamlines the game development process by defining a strict set of constraints affecting the rulesets, aesthetics, and experiences of the games created with it. The design constraints of each engine are examined along with each engine's interface, its design philosophy, a sampling of games published with it, and information gathered from developers who use it. Included in this study is the metadata from 5,001 games and survey results from 163 game developers. Analyzing these engines from a variety of perspectives may help future tool creators identify strategies for making game development more beginner-friendly, accessible, inclusive, and fun.},

We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress.},

abstract={The evolution of cloud gaming systems is substantially the security requirements for computer games. Although online game development often utilizes artificial intelligence and human computer interaction, game developers and providers often do not pay much attention to security techniques. In cloud gaming, location-based games are augmented reality games which take the original principals of the game and applies them to the real world. In other terms, it uses the real world to impact the game experience. Because the execution of such games is distributed in cloud computing, users cannot be certain where their input and output data are managed. This introduces the possibility to input incorrect data in the exchange between the gamer's terminal and the gaming platform. In this context, we propose a new gaming concept for augmented reality and location-based games in order to solve the aforementioned cheating scenario problem. The merit of our approach is to establish an accurate and verifiable proof that the gamer reached the goal or found the target. The major novelty in our method is that it allows the gamer to submit an authenticated proof related to the game result without altering the privacy of positioning data.},

Our main aims are to investigate (i) the impact communication has on trust between team members in Agile software development and (ii) the usefulness of iterated games as an experimental methodology. We use Game Theory in a simulated Agile development environment. We run 28 iterated games with 56 practitioner and student participants. Stand-up meetings are used as the communicat ion in tervent i on compared to games without such meetings to assess the levels o f trust. Our findings are that increased communication has a very large positive effect upon the level of trust between team members in an Agile setting. Our results suggest that communication improves trust in development teams. Opportunities for communication should be built into development processes. Experimental games are a complementary (to qualitative approaches) and effective method for investigating human issues in software engineering.},

In order to achieve this, the researchers proposed a teaching approach based on re-designing existing game concepts. Through a pilot of study where a particular game concept was introduced, the researchers observed, recorded and analyzed students' reactions, work process and strategies in order to provide empirical evidence that will help the academic community to have a better understanding of this area.},

abstract={The use of information technology in the e-Learning process gives positive and negative impacts. One of the positive impacts is the easy access for vast information; while the negative impacts is the ineffective learning because it makes students lazy. Previous research has used games or game elements to decrease the negative impacts of e-Learning. A survey about Algorithm Design and Analysis course was conducted, and it shows that there are some difficult subjects that need to be taught using an alternative method of learning. This research discusses how to design a video game in order to learn branch and bound algorithm and evaluate the game produced with the design. First, online surveys were done to gather the requirement, then the game design was made, then the game was implemented and evaluated. The evaluation would be used to make a better design for the next development iteration. The result of playtesting shows positive feedbacks and receives critics and suggestions. This research finds that designing a good game for learning is hard because developer must carefully define all elements in the game, so that everything is balanced and complements each other.},

This paper focuses on demonstrating the evolution of the power exchange game in electrical engineering at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The approach is based on design science, the primary target being to reflect upon the experiences gathered and lessons learned in the development process. The development of the second-generation game is described and the outcomes evaluated by elaborating on the student and teacher/admin experiences. Evaluation shows that the objectives of the game development were reached, the game is now illustrative and easy to use. It increases understanding of the market environment and supports learning of the related conceptual knowledge. For a teacher, the game is now more flexible, easily adjustable, and monitorable. The admin's workload is also considerably reduced. The changes are likely to expand the lifetime of the game, as adding new features is easier than before.},

abstract={The gaming industry has been among the most profitable industries in the world for a number of years and turns the economical gears of many countries. From big industrialized countries to small countries, they have been able to make remarkable progress in their economy by relying on gaming, and create a wonderful financial turnover. Game as a service is a new solution in the game industry for the development, deployment and operation of the game on servers instead of same running on the user's client. This concept includes the types of providing service in cloud space. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement a large-scale infrastructure for providing game development services as a comprehensive compilation solution, which is established based on service-oriented infrastructure, distributed architecture, scalability, high performance, high availability, and appropriate throughput, so that newer services such as structured security, persistence development lifecycle, realtime and batch data processing and analysis platforms and integrated communication architecture can be also achieved, in addition to more efficient operation and more than current game development technologies.},

These training methods could achieve excellent performance as FSM and contribute to other improvements: Non Player Character's (NPC) behaviors appear wide differences based on player action, and for multiple opponents in a single game, they can learn to cooperate and form anti-strategy, which could greatly augment entertainment of game. In this paper, by using Pac-man of prey and predator game genre as test-bed and Upper Confidence bound for Trees (ÜCT) algorithm to generate training data for Artificial Neural Network (ANN), we demonstrate adaptation is confirmable with cross validation result under supervised and unsupervised player modeling.

abstract={Organizations creating new products and services are increasingly adopting agile project and portfolio management capabilities to remain innovative. However, acquiring the necessary skills and spirit is troublesome for many organizations as they rely heavily on a distinct mindset and experience that can only be acquired in the process. Literature indicates that serious games can help to bridge that gap. In this paper we take the example of agile project management methods to understand how games are applied to support the acquisition of agile and entrepreneurial capabilities. In an explorative study, we conducted qualitative interviews with game developers, business consultants, and agile coaches from nine different companies, and conducted desk research on available open source serious games. Based on 475 minutes of recorded audio, 81 pages of transcripts as well as 26 identified open source games, we discuss the purpose, characteristics, and success factors of serious games and their embedment in training. Further, we provide an analysis of available games and what capabilities they address. Based on our findings we advocate for a wider use of serious games and simulations to support the adoption of agile project and portfolio management capabilities in practice. In particular, we believe the benefits of such an approach allow participants to experience, understand, and be able to work effectively across the different interconnected components of such a capability.},

The article presents the game and the results of a study of the effectiveness of its use in the process of teaching students about the architectural monuments of the city of Lublin. The main objective of the game "Architectural Jewels of Lublin" is interactive game-based learning of history. It was developed as a board game, using modern computer technologies: RFID systems, 3D modeling and printing, and real time programming. The hardware and software used in the game design can help in the process of multi-disciplinary engineer training. This game-based learning efficiency study applied a methodology using the A/B testing technique in conjunction with survey research. The level of knowledge about monuments was assessed on the basis of the survey conducted among pupils using the developed indicator. The survey was filled by various, albeit statistically similar, groups of learners before and after the game. The main result of the study is the finding of an over 31% increase in the level of knowledge among pupils as a result of playing the game "Architectural Jewels of Lublin".},

Hurricane is an extreme and dangerous natural disaster which can cause loss of property and life. However, the disaster safety learning in Malaysia only covers flood, earthquake and fire. There is no safety learning to teach hurricane in Malaysia yet. Due to that, Malaysians are still lack in preparedness for emergencies and natural disaster, especially in hurricane since only few games are available. In addition, the development and research of the instructional games based on natural disaster are still lacking. Hence, this study proposes the development of learning hurricane safety using game-based learning technique. The methodology uses Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC). A usability testing and functionality testing has conducted to test the usability and functionality of the game. Results indicate that 90% of the game participants are able to learn hurricane disaster safety effectively.},

abstract={The use of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques in game development has been mostly restricted to very specific types of game elements. PCG has seldom been deployed for generating entire game levels, a notable exception to this being dungeons: a specific type of game level often encountered in adventure and role playing games. Due to their peculiar combination of pace, gameplay, and game spaces, dungeon levels are among the most suited to showcase the benefits of PCG. This paper surveys research on procedural methods to generate dungeon game levels. We summarize common practices, discuss pros and cons of different approaches, and identify a few promising challenges ahead. In general, what current procedural dungeon generation methods are missing is not performance, but more powerful, accurate, and richer control over the generation process. Recent research results seem to indicate that gameplay-related criteria can provide this high-level control. However, this area is still in its infancy, and many research challenges still lie ahead, e.g., improving the intuitiveness and accessibility of such methods for designers. We also observe that more research is needed into generic mechanisms for automating the generation of the actual dungeon-geometric models. We conclude that the foundations for enabling gameplay-based control of dungeon-level generation are worth being researched, and that its promising results may be instrumental in bringing PCG into mainstream game development.},

abstract={Simply having a large beta test cannot consistently provide stability and performance to game servers, which are major issues in online game development. Therefore, test automations have been used in order to reduce the testing time of online games by simulating highly repetitive tasks and emulating server loads. However, in previous approaches, black box testing and scenario-based testing are not supported because they use prerecorded packets of real players as templates, or reuse a subset of the main game client for the test client. In this paper, we propose black box testing and scenario-based testing of online games as well as simple load testing. Instead of rewriting the virtual client dummy code, only the game description language and virtual game map are redefined when a new game is to be tested. In addition, an actual testing environment can be mimicked more closely, because complex and various scenarios such as attack, party play, and waypoint movement can be tested through combining actions. We have applied our tools on several online games to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={HTML5 game development is an upcoming trend that enables new technologies to interact in order to produce high quality games entirely based on the web. However, a fully functional web game requires layer upon layer of code to produce each particular game feature. This is because there are many development tools, but no specific solutions. The game developer ends up writing everything from the raw backend server to persist the game state to the end-user game features. Furthermore, the game developer needs to come up with several custom implementations to consume different providers to do things like user player login, game storage, social interaction, analytics, etc. This paper aims to present a practical solution that covers the gap between raw cloud services (the tool) and the high level functionality (the real-life game features) a game needs to be successfully built in less time (and at a lower cost) than the current solutions take.},

abstract={To design a successful Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, the ratio of snowballing and comeback occurrences to all matches played must be maintained at a certain level to ensure its fairness and engagement. Although it is easy to identify these two types of occurrences, game developers often find it difficult to determine their causes and triggers with so many game design choices and game parameters involved. In addition, the huge amounts of MOBA game data are often heterogeneous, multi-dimensional and highly dynamic in terms of space and time, which poses special challenges for analysts. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system to help game designers find key events and game parameters resulting in snowballing or comeback occurrences in MOBA game data. We follow a user-centered design process developing the system with game analysts and testing with real data of a trial version MOBA game from NetEase Inc. We apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established ones to depict the evolution of players' positions, status and the occurrences of events. Our system can reveal players' strategies and performance throughout a single match and suggest patterns, e.g., specific player' actions and game events, that have led to the final occurrences. We further demonstrate a workflow of leveraging human analyzed patterns to improve the scalability and generality of match data analysis. Finally, we validate the usability of our system by proving the identified patterns are representative in snowballing or comeback matches in a one-month-long MOBA tournament dataset.},

abstract={The growth of game development is now widely supported by software such as game engines and game frameworks. Phaser 3 is a popular HTML5 based game framework on the browser platform. However, Phaser 3 does not facilitate managing code of User Interface (UI) event component. Sometimes a game developer discovers that UI event component codes, such as buttons or joysticks that have been created, must be regenerated on subsequent projects with the same function. In this research, we proposed a reusability framework for Phaser 3 by combining the factory method and the singleton pattern in managing UI event components. The aim is to make developer productivity increased so that there is no need to repeat the algorithm or code that has been created previously. Our results show that the Phaser 3 UI standard has less a reusability value of 64,241%, while the proposed framework that was built has relatively higher reusability, that is equal to 84,576%. Game developers can add the combination of design patterns, as good software development practices, into an existing game framework to achieve code reusability without major changing on the existing game framework. This approach can also be used for the creators of game framework to use design patterns from the outset of development of game framework.},

abstract={Developers tend to reuse source code by copy/paste. This form of reuse introduces code clones to software systems. Cloning in games can happen in different levels of granularity. The extreme case is known as Game Clone where the complete project is being cloned, e.g., by making a new independent branch which the original game's source code constitutes the seed for the new branch. Although it has been more than two decades since research on code clones started, various characteristics of cloning in open source games has not been studied. Therefore, there is no specific evidence on status of cloning e.g., dominant clone type in games. In this paper, we present an empirical study on code cloning in open source games by applying a state of the art clone detector, NiCad, and a clone visualization and analysis tool, VisCad. We identify both exact and near-miss clones from more than twenty open source C, Java and Python-based games, such as Jake2, Duo, Hexen2, jChess and OpenRPG from five different categories. Furthermore, we analyze a set of metrics for code clones in several different dimensions, including language, category, clone density and clone location to answer six essential research questions about the current status of cloning in open source games. Our research illustrates that cloning happens not only at inter-project level but also intra-project, specifically in First Person Shooter games developed using C (Type-1 50% clones). Such observation concretely shows the necessity of adopting clone management systems for game development.},

abstract={Game-based learning (GBL) is growing rapidly as a gaming industry as well as a field of academic research. Developing GBL is not an easy task. It requires a tight collaboration with domain experts and this need considering a complex mix of disciplines and technologies. Learning theory, learning contents, and game design are three multidisciplinary challenges involved in proper GBL development. This paper attempts to address these challenges by demonstrating how GBL can be conceptualized from different theoretical perspectives on learning and discuss a number of fundamental elements of game design that are essential for effective learning. Then, we propose a novel methodology of design and development of GBL model that facilitates the integration of flow experience with such game elements to support learning in games. Comparisons with existing frameworks are included. Evaluation and practical performance results supported by some case study called "A day without computer-mediated technology" are also demonstrated to verify the usability of the proposed model.},

It is beneficial for students to understand not only an agile approach to IT project management, but also work with software tools. So it was necessary to design the game in computer version as well. The game was played in a board version, compared to the theoretical interpretation, the practical version of the agile approach and Scrum framework was found to be more beneficial. The agile game concept was designed so that the game could be played within 90 minutes. In order to play the game successfully, students have to go through a lecture where the rules and concept of the whole game, how agile approach works, and also the Scrum framework was explained in detail.},

Traditionally, these methods have relied on the authoring of search spaces by a designer, defining the space of all possible games for the system to author. In this paper, we instead learn representations of existing games from gameplay video and use these to approximate a search space of novel games. In a human subject study we demonstrate that these novel games are indistinguishable from human games in terms of challenge, and that one of the novel games was equivalent to one of the human games in terms of fun, frustration, and likeability.},

abstract={In a world where students are increasing digitally tethered to powerful, always on mobile devices, new models of engagement and approaches to teaching and learning are required from educators. Serious games (SGs) have proved to have instructional potential, but there is still a lack of methodologies and tools not only for their design but also to support the game analysis and assessment. This paper explores the use of SG to increase student engagement and retention. The development phase of the Circuit Warz game is presented to demonstrate how electronic engineering education can radically be reimagined to create immersive, highly engaging learning experiences that are problem-centered and pedagogically sound. The learning mechanics-game mechanics framework for the SG game analysis is introduced and its practical use in an educational game design scenario is shown as a case study.},

abstract={The research full paper examines what kind of IT tools (software and hardware) are used in project-based IT courses, where students create digital artefacts like games, apps, audio, VR worlds, web sites etc. The analysis is based on data from 46 IT courses, collected during the spring and fall semesters of 2017 at two Norwegian universities. The analysis of these data has led to a classification of the tools used by students in PjBL and guidelines for ensuring progression of tool usage in course design and study program design. The IT tools were classified into the following categories: Collaboration; Communication; Developer Platforms; Physical Tools; and Project Management. The analysis is done with reference to the existing body of literature on active learning, e.g. constructivism and constructionism, and taxonomies for learning. The study discusses ways in which tools may be used to enhance learning in the Creating level of Bloom's revised taxonomy. The data was further analysed through a "lens of progression", resulting in guidelines for study program designers and course designers, with the goal of quality assuring the tool implementation and usage in project-based IT courses and study programs. The guidelines systematically structure the tool categories with the study program design and recommend an increasing student autonomy throughout the progression of the studies. The guidelines also focus on the implementation of professional tools in IT courses, as tools are influencing students' identity development. The goal of the study is to contribute to the quality assurance of digital tool usage in IT study programs and the project-based courses, where it is important to define pre-requisites and to ensure that students learn to use different digital tools in the right order and that students know the necessary tools for their discipline.},

abstract={Games and simulations can be powerful educational tools for higher education and professional development training. At the same time, the labor and technical costs of development is sufficiently high that simulation games tend to be rather static and course or program specific. The main contribution of this paper is an effort to define a new meta-model for educational simulation games that is transferable to a broad range of disciplines and technical training fields. A meta-model provides a formal structure upon which similar categories of game play components are tied to specific learning objectives and easily updatable knowledge content while offering an infinite combination of playing experiences and maintaining consistent pedagogical standards. To illustrate, this paper draws from the application of our meta-model as used in developing a simulation game for software engineering education. Preliminary validation results are presented, in which the meta-model is used as a foundation in the architecture for a game development platform.},

In this context, this research presents a development model that aims to assist teachers and developers in the elaboration of educational games. This model is named Model Gaia Abstraction Game, which employs cooperative gaming techniques and the theory of meaningful learning in order to support game development. As a case study, the model was used in the development of Gaia Abstraction Game Object Orientation, which aims to assist the teaching and learning process of the Object-Oriented paradigm - one of the most complex concepts in current computing theory. Since this paradigm works mostly with objects abstraction and classification, the concept is not always clear for the students, even though it is core for the initial subjects in computing courses. This study is grounded on researches of authors who approach the importance of games as facilitators in the learning process. The major contributions provided by this study are to: explain how the game can help increase students' interest; make the classes dynamic and engaging; help students learn in a playful and pleasurable way; facilitate the mediation of knowledge; and create a mutual cooperation environment among students, promoting their full development through motivation.},

abstract={This paper presents a review of the literature on gamification design frameworks. Gamification, understood as the use of game design elements in other contexts for the purpose of engagement, has become a hot topic in the recent years. However, there's also a cautionary tale to be extracted from Gartner's reports on the topic: many gamification-based solutions fail because, mostly, they have been created on a whim, or mixing bits and pieces from game components, without a clear and formal design process. The application of a definite design framework aims to be a path to success. Therefore, before starting the gamification of a process, it is very important to know which frameworks or methods exist and their main characteristics. The present review synthesizes the process of gamification design for a successful engagement experience. This review categorizes existing approaches and provides an assessment of their main features, which may prove invaluable to developers of gamified solutions at different levels and scopes.},

abstract={Analyzing telemetry data of player behavior in computer games is a topic of increasing interest for industry and research, alike. When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

abstract={Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element's nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones). Moreover, MC-GAN uses only one complex model trained once per game. Once it is trained for that specific game, there will be no need for training to produce a new level of that game, a considerable step in the developing industry. Considering that MC-GAN is only the beginning of this big journey; therefore, it is now the best choice for developing web games since they are compact and straightforward. This article first briefly introduces GamGAN and its features; afterward, we get through MC-GAN features and compare them to other similar works.},

abstract={In this paper, we present an approach for automated evaluation and generation of videogames made with PuzzleScript, a description-based scripting language for authoring games, which was created by game designer Stephen Lavelle [1]. We have developed a system that automatically discovers solutions for a multitude of videogames that each possess different game mechanics, rules, level designs, and win conditions. In our approach, we first developed a set of general level state heuristics, which estimates how close a given game level is to being solved. It is used to adapt the best-first search algorithm to implement a general evaluation approach for PuzzleScript games called GEBestFS. Next, we developed an evolutionary framework that automatically generates novel game mechanics from scratch by evolving game design rulesets and evaluating them using GEBestFS. This was achieved by developing a set of general ruleset heuristics to assess the playability of a game based on its game mechanics. From the results of our approach, we showcase that a description-based language enables the development of general methods for automatically evaluating games authored with it. Additionally, we illustrate how an evolutionary approach can be used together with these methods to to automatically design alternate or novel game mechanics for authored games.},

We also propose ways for designers to use this tool to ask and answer designs questions. To illustrate this, we integrated the library with It's Alive!, a game in development by the authors, and 2D Roguelike, an open source game from the Unity asset store. We demonstrate the tool's ability to answer both game design and player modeling questions; and provide the results of system validation experiments.},

abstract={Many practical classes at technical universities develop various student skills. The curricula of IT programs include practical classes. A collaborative project is an example of such a class. Students work in small groups and perform tasks in assigned projects. While the work is being done, students learn many skills that will be useful in their future professional careers. Universities may allow students to use professional equipment for both improving their competencies and increasing the quality of their projects. Students may be more eager to participate in these types of projects. The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal for the implementation of sophisticated project classes for computer science students using an optical motion capture laboratory. Additionally, a survey among ICT students at a technical university was conducted. The results show how familiar students are with motion capture technology and game development software. Students also indicated which part of the project they wanted to participate in. The results clearly show that there is a deficiency in 3D skills among computer science students. They are aware of this and would like to become more familiar with modern technologies. They are eager to attend classes that use a motion capture system. The students are the most interested in using game engines to create games. They are also interested in creating 3D models and defining moves. They are the least interested in performing the tedious post-processing step. The presented projects using modern technologies are an important step in creating a new generation of classes.},

abstract={Context: By definition, gamification is the application of game design elements in non-game contexts. This deployment of gamification usually induces a further layer of complexity on top of the current task. Thus, to minimize the caused cognitive load, we argue that taking account of the gamification aesthetics is as important as deploying different and elaborated gamification mechanics. Objective: In this paper, we deal with the cognitive overload made by the deployment of gamification in serious contexts such as education, health and work. We thereby emphasize on the importance of applying established design theories such as semiotics (the signs theory) in reducing the caused cognitive load. Method: We have therefore designed a quantitative study, to which we have invited participants with different ages and backgrounds. The study consists of a series of puzzles (taken from a prior study of ours), to which two achievement systems with different badges (icons) were designed. The participants have afterwards to answer various weighted questions related to their perceptions of both achievement systems. Hypothesis: In this work, we argue that badges, whose icon design takes consideration of the signs theory are better perceived than badges, whose design did not follow this theory.},

abstract={In a typical new product development (NPD) project, there are many alternatives, ranging from incremental changes or re-engineering of an existing product in order to compete better in an existing market, to breakthrough thinking and the development of a new product using new technologies that satisfy the needs and expectations of customers in new markets. We tested the hypothesis that competition influences the decisions of entrepreneurs managing NPD projects. The findings presented in this paper are based on a controlled experiment conducted in several project management courses using a simulation game. The results reveal that a competitive environment in which participants compete for the same customers tends to impact the planning of NPD projects. The paper contributes to the managerial practice by offering integration of “What if?” analysis in the planning phase of NPD projects. It can assist entrepreneurs to evaluate the tradeoffs of the feasible alternatives in a noncompetitive environment, and explain how market conditions, such as competitor entry behavior, affect the project plan. A decision on the best project plan, among all the feasible project plans, is based on management strategy that takes into account the level of competition along with the uncertainty in the technology, market, and environment. The game, combined with a simulation-based training tool, used in this study, offer an opportunity to develop and to try different alternatives for the management of NPD projects without risking the consequences of project failure.},

abstract={Soft skills are increasingly important to the engineering profession and course modifications are often needed to ensure students have opportunities to practice them prior to graduation. This suggests that engineering programs need to go beyond simply offering industry-based capstone courses and internships. Role-play has a long history as a tool for learning. It can be used to simulate real world practices in environments where consequences can be mitigated safely. This paper discusses the use of team role-play activities to simulate the experience of working in a professional, game development studio as a means of enhancing an advanced undergraduate game design course. In conjunction with the role-play, a gamification framework was used within the course to allow students to customize their course participation. Gamification was used to reward students for compliance with software process steps and for taking the initiative to improve their “soft skills”. In this project allowing students to negotiate the nature of their activities and rewards helped them develop those skills. The student feedback obtained and the authors' own lessons learned are being used to plan the next iteration of this course.},

abstract={The software engineering process for games has enough special structure that it can be formulated as a kind of game itself. This, in turn, permits the teaching of game construction in a unique way with new potential to motivate students. We present a new game design client program for an existing collaborative problem-solving website known as CoSolve. The client was built with an emphasis on increased interaction and fine control over a problem's state. With this comes the opportunity to more easily design and test games in the CoSolve space. It is our hope that this will teach and inspire student users to learn more about game design, problem posing, and programming in general.},

abstract={During the last couple of decades, there has been an exponential improvement in neuroimaging technologies that allowed researchers noninvasive assessment of cognitive workload, short term memory, and spatial/navigational behaviors in humans. Through the use of new experimental paradigms and brain imaging devices, researchers have gained deeper insight into the neural correlates of emotion, cognition and motor control. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems utilize neuroimaging tools to detect brain activation evoked by a specific thinking process and convert it to a command. We have developed a game environment called “MindTactics” as a test platform for BCI devices to conceptualize experimental cognitive paradigms in ecologically valid environments as well as test BCI gameplay paradigms. Unlike traditional video games where the challenge to the user is the designed game mechanics, BCI based gameplay also involves mastering the use of the BCI device itself. The purpose of this project is to develop compelling BCI game design methods. MindTactics is capable of integrating data from multiple devices including the optical brain imaging based BCI developed at Drexel University, and it records behavioral log files for further analysis.},

abstract={Game based learning is still not widely accepted for work based learning purposes. Though game based learning has been integrated into formal education in school and university, corporate human resource departments still rely on more traditional learning approaches, since computer games are often seen as more of an opposite to work processes. In this paper an implementation guideline for the integration of game based learning into the corporate competence development is established. Starting from an extensive literature research the concept presented in this paper has been validated in expert workshops with managers and human resource experts. It was examined in how far game based learning could contribute to the vocational work based training and which steps need to be undertaken to apply game based learning. Starting from the theoretical concepts of motivation theory the main design options in creating instructional games are analyzed. In addition to that a classification of different types of games in relation to their corporate application fields has been developed. The authors recommend increasing the corporate use of game based learning as part of the vocational work based learning to reach better the future qualification requirements of companies as well as the training of less education experienced workers. A structured implementation process is suggested and a matching concept of game design in relation to the work tasks is presented.},

abstract={Simulation games are a well-known concept for teaching in a practical way. Especially for project management training, simulation games are helpful. Students can try out different management strategies and gain experience without endangering real projects. To provide a good learning environment, it is important to simulate the employees managed by the player as realistically as possible. However, existing approaches only use simple models to simulate human behavior, missing psychological aspects like motivation and interpersonal interaction, and therefore are not detailed enough for leadership and project management training. We present a new decision-making model based on findings of psychology, which can be used for simulating a more realistic human behavior. We use heuristics for calculating the motivational force of all potential actions an employee has, in order to decide which he will choose. This calculation is not only based on the project's state and schedule, but also on emotional factors like the preferences and aversions of the employee. Within our approach, we implemented a decision-making model, which is not limited to our game concept and can also be adapted for other simulation games.},

abstract={New online stores and digital distribution methods have led to the development of alternative monetization models for video-games, such as free-to-play games with advertisements. Although there are many games using such models, until now the effect on the player experience from such interruptions has not been studied. In this controlled experiment, we requested that participants (N=236) play one of three different versions of a platformer game with: 1) no interruptions, 2) 30-second video advertisements, and 3) a multiple-choice questionnaire. We then evaluated the effects on the player experience. The study shows differences in their experiences, namely in: competence, immersion, annoyance, affects, and the reliability of the questionnaire answers. The contribution of this work is to identify which player experience variables are affected by interruptions, which can be valuable for selecting the business model and guiding the game design process.},

abstract={Type 1 diabetes patients have to control their blood insulin throughout their lives. Mastering this process increases one's quality of life as well as one's life expectancy. Since the 1990s, video games have been successfully informing diabetic children about the impacts of dietary habits or providing assistance by logging, visualising and rewarding a balanced insulin level. In the long list of diabetes-related games, some design choices frequently re-occur: (1) The player's identification with the game's protagonist whose metabolism needs to be balanced, (2) the aforementioned log-and-reward mechanism that rewards the player's own compliance with insulin medication and proper diet with game-related bonuses, and (3) a focus on the biochemical basics of the disease. We have investigated numerous game titles and several reviews on diabetes-related games, but could not identify a single game that incorporated all three core mechanics. For this reason, we propose a game design concept that merges these mechanics but, despite these interwoven goals, remains accessible for kids.},

abstract={Lack of information about new users is a common problem in recommendation system and the same is true for the tourism recommendation system. For tourism domain, the key information is to know about how tourists choose where to go and what to do. In the past, questionnaires and surveys were commonly used. However, with the present advanced technology to get faster and easier, more convenient information is utilized. This study proposes an effective game for identifying travelers' behaviors in the chosen tourist sites in Chiang Mai. The game development process follows the Doppler Interactive game development life cycle and the game designed uses the UX/UI design laws, such as Fitts' Law, Hick's Law and Gestalt theory. The researchers separated the tourism photos into six groups: nightlife & party, cultural heritage & religions, city & shopping, nature & animal, adventure & hard sport and healthy & soft sport. We used cartoon pictures to identify what travelers liked to do most. Then, we gave questionnaires to compare if what the travelers clicked on the game was the same as what they answered in the questionnaires. The results were the game took only 1.42 minutes to identify travelers' preference and game accuracy was 74.33%.},

abstract={Recursion is one of the most powerful problem-solving techniques in computer science, but many students seem to struggle with the concept of recursion. In addition, the instructors find it hard to teach this concept using traditional teaching method. This paper presents a game module titled "Recursive Runner" that aims to reinforce student understanding of recursion in a game. Four undergraduate students developed the game with GameMaker Studio in three months. The game was designed for short gameplay time and it does not require any prior experience in gaming. The objective of the game is to provide the students with a fun environment to visualize and follow the flow of execution of recursive functions. This paper presents the game design and implementation in detail and shares our experiences in using this module in the CSC1311 Computer Programming II and CSC2331 Data Structures classes at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU). A pretest, a posttest and a survey were developed and used in the evaluation process. In addition, a lab assignment was designed to use with the game to evaluate student understanding of the concept. Initial assessment outcomes show promising results and the feedback is positive according to the survey and interview.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the idea that game design, player modeling, and procedural content generation may offer new methods for modern psychological assessment, allowing for daily cognitive assessment in ways previously unseen. We suggest that games often share properties with psychological tests and that the overlap between the two domains might allow for creating games that contain assessment elements and provide examples from the literature that already show this. While approaches like these are typically seen as adding noise to a particular instrument in a psychometric context, research in player modeling demonstrates that it is possible to extract reliable measures corresponding to psychological constructs from in-game behavior and performance. Given these observations, we suggest that the combination of game design, player modeling, and procedural content generation offers new opportunities for conducting psychometric testing with a higher frequency and a higher degree of personalization than has previously been possible. Finally, we describe how we are currently implementing the first version of this vision in the form of an application for mobile devices that will soon be used in upcoming user studies.},

abstract={Gamification is the application of game mechanics and concepts outside the context of games, although it can be ineffective when applied to education without properly implementing the core concepts of game-design into educational tasks themselves. Implementing gamification elements (such as points, badges and leaderboards) increases motivation and engagement with a system, however, this is hypothesised to be merely a novelty effect that shifts existing intrinsic motivations to extrinsic ones. Providing a context for this research is the Doubtfire Learning Management System (LMS), which implements task-oriented portfolio assessment and ideologies that parallel those of gamification via unit task design and encouraging a feedback loop to students. Upon extensive analysis of gamification literature, we propose how certain gamification components could be implemented into the LMS to increase student engagement and motivation further.},

abstract={Practical, collaborative training of severe emergencies that occur too rarely within regular curricular training programs (e.g., anaphylactic shock in children patients) is difficult to realize. Multi-user virtual reality and serious game technologies can be used to provide collaborative training in dynamic settings [1], [2]. However, actual training effects seem to depend on a high presence and supportive usability [2]. EPICSAVE Lifesaving Decisions shows a novel approach that aims at further improving on these factors using an emotional scenario and collaborative game mechanics. We present a trailer video of a game sketch which creatively explores serious game design for collaborative virtual reality training systems. The game invites two paramedic trainees and one paramedic trainer into a dramatic scenario at a family theme park: A 5-year old child shows symptoms of anaphylactic shock. While the trainees begin their diagnostics procedures, a bystander, the girl's grandfather, intervenes and challenges the players' authority. Our research explores how VR game mechanics, i.e., optional narrative, authority skills and rewards, mini games, and interactive virtual characters may extend training quality and user experience over pure VR training simulations. The video exemplifies a concept that extends prior developments of a multi-user VR training simulation setup presented in [2], [3].},

It also aims to answer the questions: `What are players' perceptions of alternative input methods? and `Can playing a game with an alter native input method increase players' immersion and entertainment?' We created a simple two-player game Project Zion, which can be played with any one of a number of different input devices, both traditional and alternative, e.g. mouse, keyboard, Xbox 360 controller, Wii Remote, dance mat, Phantom Omni haptic device, SpacePilot Pro, and webcam. We then enlisted participants to play the game in pairs with one of the selection of input methods (each player in the pair can use a different input method to their opponent) and then asked them to fill in a questionnaire about their previous game playing experience, opinions on games that make use of alternative input methods. The project comes to the conclusion that alternative input methods can increase the immersion and fun players perceive, provided that the input method used fits the game mechanics. Players express negative feelings when playing a game with an input method that does not suit the game mechanics, feeling that it is merely a gimmick. The result also shows that players' perceptions of alternative input methods are tied to their previous experiences with that input method.},

abstract={This paper introduces an information-theoretic method for selecting a subset of problems which gives the most information about a group of problem-solving algorithms. This method was tested on the games in the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework, allowing us to identify a smaller set of games that still gives a large amount of information about the abilities of different game-playing agents. This approach can be used to make agent testing more efficient. We can achieve almost as good discriminatory accuracy when testing on only a handful of games as when testing on more than a hundred games, something which is often computationally infeasible. Furthermore, this method can be extended to study the dimensions of the effective variance in game design between these games, allowing us to identify which games differentiate between agents in the most complementary ways.},

abstract={Gamification has become a trend over the last years, especially in non-game environments such as business systems. With the aim to increase the users' engagement and motivation, existing or new information systems are enriched with game design elements. Before the technical implementation, the gamification concept is created. However, creation of such concepts is an informal and error-prone process, i.e., the definition and exchange of game mechanics is done in natural language or using spreadsheets. This becomes especially relevant, if the gamification concept is handed over to the implementation phase in which IT-experts have to manually translate informal to formal concepts without having gamification expertise. In this paper, we describe a novel, declarative, and formal domain-specific language to define gamification concepts. Besides that the language is designed to be readable and partially write able by gamification experts, the language is automatically compilable into gamification platforms without involving IT-experts.},

The Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis is introduced and its use in an educational game design scenario is shown as a case study.},

abstract={Software applications continue to challenge user privacy when users interact with them. Privacy practices (e.g. Data Minimisation (DM), Privacy by Design (PbD) or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) and related “privacy engineering” methodologies exist and provide clear instructions for developers to implement privacy into software systems they develop that preserve user privacy. However, those practices and methodologies are not yet a common practice in the software development community. There has been no previous research focused on developing “educational” interventions such as serious games to enhance software developers' coding behaviour. Therefore, this research proposes a game design framework as an educational tool for software developers to improve (secure) coding behaviour, so they can develop privacy-preserving software applications that people can use. The elements of the proposed framework were incorporated into a gaming application scenario that enhances the software developers' coding behaviour through their motivation. The proposed work not only enables the development of privacy-preserving software systems but also helping the software development community to put privacy guidelines and engineering methodologies into practice.},

abstract={Online gaming has now become an extremely competitive business. As there are so many game titles released every month, gamers have become more difficult to please and fickle in their allegiances. Therefore, it would be beneficial if we could forecast how addictive a game is before publishing it on the market. With the capability of game addictiveness forecasting, developers will be able to continuously adjust the game design and publishers will be able to assess the potential market value of a game in its early development stages. In this paper, we propose to forecast a game's addictiveness based on players' emotional responses when they are first exploring the game. Based on the account activity traces of 11 commercial games, we develop a forecasting model that predicts a game's addictiveness index according to electromyographic measures of players' two facial muscles. We hope that with our methodology, the game industry could optimize the odds of successful investments and target more accurately the provision of a better entertaining experience.},

abstract={Integrating user-generated content into digital games helps to increase re-usability and to decrease development effort. In terms of learning games, the content creation can be extended to the learning parts of the game as well, e.g., allowing teachers to create custom games for their students. In this work, we propose a method of how to create learning games with arbitrary user-generated learning content. This includes not only different topics of learning content, but also different types of knowledge acquisition. To do this we combine a static game scenario with lightweight HTML5-based mini games. Learning content can be conveniently added through a web-based authoring tool that does not require any programming or game design knowledge. In addition to that, we created a game prototype based on the Unity3D engine that uses a tower defence game setting to integrate the learning content. These mini games are retrieved from the backend service at runtime. The implemented solution already allows for the integration of arbitrary content and can easily extended without altering the game client.},

abstract={There has been a growing need to teach professional development skills to engineering students at Iowa State University. Students are often lacking these skills even though they are desired skills to have both for academic success and in the workplace. For our research, we are exploring using virtual reality to teach four professional development skills to students. These skills are leadership, teamwork, communication and ethics. We are using virtual reality as an innovative tool to teach students these skills in an interactive and fun environment. This work-in-progress paper will discuss the activities that are being developed to teach engineering students professional development skills at Iowa State University. In this paper, we will discuss three activities that are being developed to teach these four different professional development skills. Our framework for these activities is using Game Based Learning (GBL), which is based on Problem Based Learning (PBL). Each activity will be based on a problem that students must work together to solve. Through this interaction, students will learn one or more of the professional development skills outlined in this paper. The goals and learning outcomes of each activity will then be outlined and discussed in more detail. We will outline the execution of each activity and how the interaction between the students and the virtual reality system will be accomplished. In this paper, we will show our current work in progress of the development of the game environment used in these activities. This will include screen shots and other examples of the game environment for each activity. The development platform used for these activities is the Unity platform, a free game development software package that includes tools for working with virtual reality. The virtual reality headset that will be used with Unity will be the HTC Vive. This allows us to have an interactive environment where students can see and hear in the virtual space and use controllers to interact with objects in the virtual space. We are also adding physical props that can interact with the virtual space. The addition of these props is designed to allow multiple players to be involved while keeping costs low and increasing the portability of the system.},

abstract={Game design demands a comprehensive understanding of the audience. Although recent developments in the video game industry have heightened the need to involve players in the design process, the research to date has tended to focus on participatory design with children rather than older adults. Moreover, due to the lack of information regarding gamers' social context and their experiences, there has been little agreement on whether video games with a multiplayer dimension are suitable for this age group. Through online and face-to-face group workshops with five experienced and five novice gamers aged 50 and over, we discuss the potential of social network games for older adults and the main game design components, which can encourage them to play. The results of this study suggest that a player versus environment (PvE) mode is preferred to player versus player (PvP) games and that collaboration between players should be prioritized over competition. This target also seems to prefer off-game communication tools to extend their virtual relationships.},

abstract={The purpose of rehabilitation is to improve the movement of stroke patients so that they can independently perform daily tasks on their own. Conventional therapy is a tedious exercise which usually reduces the motivation of the patient to do the exercises. Video game is a way that can motivate and help patients recover their motor skills, and also act as a deterrent pain. Video games have been used in physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychotherapy. In order to increase mental satisfaction and physical vitality in rehabilitation therapy, some therapists have tried to use the off-the-shelf digital game devices in rehabilitation and have found effective treatment outcomes in addition to enhancing patients' treatment motivation. Although many studies have been done in this field, there is still lacking the existing recovery game, because too many different demands must be met for each type of therapy. There is one disadvantage at the beginning of the game because patients have difficulty understanding how to use it. The current recovery games are less fun and participative for the user, while the popular games have fewer components to use in rehabilitation training. Furthermore, post-stroke patients find it difficult to get a friend to play or spend time with them every day, which will make them feel isolated. Therefore, rehabilitation exercise games that support multi-player will provide a higher motivation than the single-player. Since most stroke patients suffer from cognitive impairment, cognitive challenge levels are also the key factors in the design of the game so that it does not become an obstacle for the recovery process. Therefore, this study develops a prototype of a rehabilitation exercise game that contains aspects of the social context, the type of movement and cognitive challenges. It also provides usability in game design, according to a post-stroke stage so that they can perform recovery activities based on their ability. In addition, this study highlights technology and rehabilitation exercise games in Malaysia.},

abstract={Using automation to ensure reliability of a tricky card based game application is not a child's play, especially when the underlying engine is cocos-2dx, which is the world's no. 1 open-source and a cross-platform game development platform. This paper explores the challenges that can be faced while automating a game developed using cocos-2dx, such as dynamic rendering of game elements, overcoming the limitations in using automation tools like selenium in the absence of any locators to identify the visible or active elements to perform any operation. This paper further discusses the approach to bring efficient, generic and re-usable solution for these challenges while automating a multiplayer card game developed using cocos-2dx. This multi-layered approach spans across the following areas: 1) The mechanism for working and communicating with cocos-2dx web and native game client. 2) Approach for automating multiplayer game using FSM. 3) Automating the game play based on game rules which follows a heuristic approach. The benefit of this automation approach is that it makes the code 'device agnostic, which helps to run the same code against multiple devices of varying screen size and resolutions. This approach also makes the code robust, reducing any false failures since the interaction with the client is done via Javascript, which lot of UI automation tool still does not guarantee.},

We have conducted a literature review on authoring tools and pervasive games to (i) collect the common scenarios of current location-based mobile games, and (ii) features of authoring tools for these games. Additionally, we have also used the focus groups methodology to find new scenarios for location-based mobile games, in particular regarding how augmented reality can be used in these games. Both literature review and focus groups provide us a set of requirements to design a software architecture for our authoring tool, a web-based application where games are created and executed. In our approach, games are designed as a set of missions that can be ordered or not. Players use mobile devices to perform these missions in order to complete each game. Our main objective is to provide a software solution to enable non-programmers users to design, build and run location-based mobile games. In order to evaluate our tool, we present a game design called "Battle for Fortaleza", and how this game is implemented in our solution.},

abstract={The traditional approach to achieve high metadata quality in image description is to use subject experts. However, cultural heritage institutions often lack the human resources to handle the amount of material that is in need of description. One of the possible solutions to this problem is applying the gamification approach in the process of description. Many studies have shown that applying game design features outside traditional game environments can increase the motivation and productivity, and that those games can be particularly effective in invoking intrinsic motivations and overall enjoyment. However, there is a need to explore the quality of such game-generated tags in comparison with using controlled vocabularies and traditional approaches. In this paper, we compare game-generated image labels and professional descriptors. First, a subject expert using controlled vocabulary added descriptors for each image. Then, by using a gamified platform for collecting semantic annotations of digitized images, game-generated tags were collected. In the final stage, game-generated labels were evaluated by the subject expert in the context of appropriateness of using them as descriptors within a standardized system. Results have shown that gamegenerated labels can serve as a basis for high quality labels suitable for including a standardized description in order to enhance description and retrieval.},

They maintain this potentiality through blog posts on progress and on the development environment. Players also use rhetorics of potentiality in game reviews and forum posts. Together these sites maintain the vision that the game is currently incomplete while also reaffirming a shared belief in a positive outcome of the development.},

abstract={Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the developed world. Motion based video games show promise in helping people with hemiparesis (or partial paralysis) due to a stroke recover motor abilities. However, commercially available games are typically only playable by a minority of people with hemiparesis. Custom games can address the needs of a broader group of people with hemiparesis, but are expensive and time consuming to build. Environments that enable therapists to quickly create motion-based games tailored to individuals with hemiparesis may enable faster research exploration of the rehabilitation game design space and, ultimately, wider use of games in stroke recovery. This paper presents guidelines for and research challenges in the design of programming tools for therapists drawn from two studies. In the first study, we asked ten therapists to describe the relationship between players performing therapeutic motions and the motions of objects within the game world. Based on the language study results, we augmented an existing novice programming environment with support to detect and react to therapy motions.

abstract={Research interest in gamification is currently enjoying global attention. However, while game design is often the focus of these gamification systems, interface design is overlooked. This is due to the expectations of field stakeholders and experts who consider interface to be only a minor element of the gamification experience. The aim of this paper is to propose a classification method that categorizes the gamification element into tangible and intangible. This new classification would provide a clear perspective about the elements before the design and development of an educational game has even begun. The proposed new method of classification would save researcher’s time and effort by assisting in the selection of the most appropriate gamification elements for the situation at hand.},

abstract={Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. Gamification is a relatively new trend that has been applied in various domains, including Software Engineering. However, few studies have explored the potential of gamification in the context of Software Engineering education. In this paper, we describe an experience of introducing two game elements, namely badges and leaderboards, in an introductory Software Engineering course. Our goal is to evaluate the students' perception on the impact of these elements in their motivation towards the course. We conducted a survey with 18 participants for quantitative results, and a series of interviews with 6 participants for a qualitative perspective on the results. We observed that students received badges positively, while there were mixed results about the use of leaderboards in our strategy. The main benefits on the use of these elements is that they provide social recognition rewards for students. In addition, the use of badges establishes further objectives for students to strive for, besides grades and approval.},

abstract={As of the early 20th century, a significant body of research has been published that shows how effective game-based learning and gamification techniques can be compared to other methods. However, creating games can be time consuming and usually demands a significant effort. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design and development of a novel framework for the rapid design of body-motion-based customizable game-like applications. This framework consists of two components: i) an interface that allows the user to design the game and capture the motion data, and ii) a customizable game for learning and training using off-the-shelf motion capture sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. The game is automatically configured based on the output of the game design interface. In order to evaluate the proposed system, a pilot use case for the Latin dance Salsa has been selected. Preliminary small-scaled experiments with latin dance students have shown the great potential of the proposed application.},

abstract={Pervasive learning is a branch of mobile learning with an emphasis on context-awareness. Pervasive learning spaces (PLSs) create bridges from the real world to the virtual world, allowing the context-sensitive utilization of real-world objects and information in the learning process. Thus far, no model of technology integration for PLSs exists. We present a three-year process during which several game-based PLSs were developed. Based on the development experiences and a series of literature analyses, we present a technology integration model for game-based PLSs. The model meets the requirements of context, pedagogy, and game-design with technology. From these requirements, we derive three critical factors for technology integration in PLSs: 1) context-awareness, 2) available resources, and 3) unobtrusiveness of the technology. The model is discussed and evaluated through applying the model to the development process of LieksaMyst, a game-based PLS for a museum. User perceptions and usability of our games are also evaluated. The model can be utilized by PLS designers and developers for determining which requirements must be considered when integrating technology into a PLS. While the foundations of a technology integration model are now laid, work remains to be done in identifying development and evaluation methods based on the model.},

abstract={During the years of creating serious games in multidisciplinary areas, the authors of this paper experimented with multiple methods of game development with the goal of helping, educating people and eliminating the barriers arising from communication happening during software development. The method that proved to be the most successful is what the authors called the Users' Focus In Needs & Development (UFIND) method. UFIND is based on continuous feedback from the user, on usability and on gamification as it steps away from the classical software development methods. The aim of UFIND is that instead of the tasks, not only the application, but the user as well should always be in the center of focus while making the application. This also means that certain abilities, even the cognitive skills of the user can be developed further in each test cycle. In this paper, the authors would like to define and introduce the UFIND method of application development and compare it to other, traditional development methods. All five phases of the UFIND method are elaborated in this paper, thus giving a detailed look into this user-centered application development method and presenting why it is useful for developing serious games.},

We have conducted a pilot experiment in order to evaluate the effect of this adaptation on game and player satisfaction. We stated as hypotheses that context adaptation does not have effects on the game and player satisfaction. We have developed two versions of a mobile game and a virtual city to test these hypotheses.

abstract={Making innovative, cohesive and appealing games has become inherently more difficult given the ever increasing competition in the digital games' market. Manually creating game content is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, alternative approaches for game content creation are relevant for increasing the efficiency of the game development process. This is where procedural techniques step in. Even though they have been used by commercial games since the 1980s, it was only in recent years that this kind of approach has been given the righteous attention in the academic context. In this work, we propose a procedural content generation approach for creating infinite environments for a 2D platform runner game. The approach consists of a Genetic Algorithm that innovatively takes into account environment aesthetics as well as game's physics and rules in its fitness function. Therefore, the created environments should be pleasant and possible to be overcome by the player. An instantiation of the approach was developed using the Godot Game Engine. Time viability for in-game real-time generation and convergence to high/stable fitness values were experimentally evaluated. Our tests indicated parameter ranges that performed best in terms of environment quality and processing time were mutation rates between 0.5 % and 1 % aligned with a population ranging from 50 to 100 individuals. This approach is expandable to other games that have a tileman-based environments.},

abstract={Game-based learning has a certain potential in the domain of the technological enhanced learning. On the other hand, the advantages of an adaptive system is obvious especially in the educational domain. The process of learning can be improved if a serious game can adapt to the needs, preferences and behavior of the players or the needs of educational experts. However, it is hard to realize highly effective adaptive game because it is difficult for educational experts to realize their didactic ideas directly in the system. In the design phase of the serious game development, storyboards are used as specifications of player experience. In this paper, we describe how adaptive behaviors are implemented in a serious game with the storyboard interpretation technology, with which non-programmers can modify the game system behaviors. To make a system adaptive, the system must learn about the users, build up a user model, and then react or change the system behavior according to the user model. To realize these functionalities in a serious game, we use the Inventory of Learning Styles (LSI) as a user model and the storyboarding to describe different system behaviors depending on the modeled user profiles. Taking a large-scale training applications in the training of disaster management staff as an example, we show how different system behaviors are represented in a storyboard. Through the description of the example, we show that storyboard is an effective tool to change the learning environment for educational experts who are not familiar with programming language.},

abstract={The degree of difficulty is a key element of fun in digital games. Players enjoy games and improve their skills if the difficulty is set in their personal Flow Zones. The existing Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a suitable technique to automatically control the difficulty within the proper range in games. However, sometimes players feel uncomfortable when they recognize that the difficulty is being modified automatically. We devised a new game design concept called "Dynamic Pressure Cycle Control," which still adds fun for players even when the difficulty exceeds the proper range. Our method's fundamental idea is to modify the difficulty extremely, increasing and decreasing it beyond the Flow Zone. We implemented our method combined with DDA and conducted experiments to verify it through playtesting. Results show that the proposed method succeeds to add a new element of fun to the game. Also, show the existence of a game design method which offers comfort to players even when they recognized the intentional change of difficulty during gameplay time.},

This tool is created due to the lack of a comprehensive value framework for design and intended to be useful in general design practices.

abstract={While K-12 STEM Education test scores have been steadily improving over the past decade in the United States, achievement gaps still remain among minorities and women in STEM courses and careers. There are numerous factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, low status and other sociocultural factors in classrooms that impede learning. Difficulties in STEM Education engagement and encumbered participation are often due to decontextualized learning - incongruence between meaningful contexts and learning processes. Game based learning methods are common STEM Ed models that provide youth with extrinsically motivating knowledge frameworks for learning, however, research has proven that even these procedural spaces often are disconnected from students' social and cultural realities. Amidst the STEM Ed achievement gaps problematic are similar disparities found in popular video game spaces, where there is a less than 20% chance that these same disparity groups will navigate computational worlds with protagonists that look like them. These gamers/students are lacking the “under-the-hood” (STEM) knowledge of the very games they engage with on a daily basis. This contradiction is central to this paper and the conceptualization of Metatuning - a game design pedagogical framework that aims to empower students to discover their identities as agents of change, and to see that game design can nurture their internal motivations. In this case study, Metatuning was used to foster an intrinsically motivated learning environment, where a young designer was able to iteratively design a social justice themed game that empowered her as a designer and an aspiring doctor.},

abstract={Auto battler is currently one of the most popular types of video games on the market. In such type of games, players set up their own lineup of characters which combat automatically with other competitors. There are numerous kinds of chess pieces, lineups and bonuses in the game, which make the balance problem of game design extremely critical and challenging. In this paper, we use Chess Rush to investigate the methodology of evaluating the strength standards of lineups in auto battler games, and build a system for implementing such measurement. A neural network model is firstly trained for quick strength evaluation of the lineup. The genetic algorithm is then adopted and modified for the purpose of lineup mining of auto battler. Finally, strong lineups can be obtained under certain constraints. In this way, game developers can complete a balanced analysis before the game goes online. Moreover, the proposed approach can be generalized to balance analysis tasks of other games.},

Serious games are games that are developed according to the concept, “It is possible through game play to obtain some kind of knowledge while having fun. Through these serious games, there has been an active movement toward fun learning using games in education at school and internal training at organizations. In contrast, at universities the level of learning programming differs significantly depending on the academic background of the student and there are issues with traditional programming education learning because the student does not feel enjoyment and is not interested in information engineering. As a countermeasure, teaching methods and teaching aids etc. have been cited as themes and learning through the utilization of serious games and game development has been proposed to tackle these themes. In this paper we propose and evaluate serious games for programming learning based on the concept “Learning programming through gaming”.},

abstract={Engineering students need complex skills to be effective in college and post-graduate employment. Beyond technical skills, the ability to integrate varied types of information is essential for competence in applying engineered solutions to real-life situations. While research shows that project-based learning favorably affects engineering student success and retention as well as recruitment of diverse populations to STEM, it is challenging to find ways to incorporate projects during the first two years, where in the U.S. general education requirements typically precede major course work. As a work in progress, we report on the first phase of an experiment at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) using a sophomore-level humanities course to teach information literacy. Students develop a pedagogical role-play game to explore a historical situation simulating engineered solutions. The game offers the advantages of project-based learning within a traditionally framed classroom environment, and before students address complex engineering problems within their major areas of study. To assess the effectiveness of our educational approach we reviewed the quality and type of sources located by students and completed a textual analysis of students' reflective essays. Through game development, students effectively located information, and saw value in the research skills they gained.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method to help understanding the influence of a game design on player retention. Using Far Cry® 4 data, we illustrate how playtime measures can be used to identify time periods where players are more likely to stop playing. First, we show that a benchmark can easily be performed for every game available on Steam using publicly available data. Then, we introduce how survival analysis can help to model the influence of game variables on player retention. Game environment and player characteristics change over time and tracking systems already store those changes. But existing model which deals with time varying covariate cannot scale on huge datasets produced by video game monitoring. That is why we propose a model that can both deal with time varying covariates and is well suited for big datasets. As a given game variable can have a changing effect over time, we also include time-varying coefficients in our model. We used this survival analysis model to quantify the effect of Far Cry 4 weapons usage on player retention.},

abstract={Experience design is a vital factor in improving course material understanding in educational game design. In Role-Playing Game (RPG) educational games, the activity is one of the main elements in shaping the experience. However, the absence of a model for activity design in educational RPG causes the resulting activities to be poorly conceived and lack of synchronization between gaming and educational principles. This paper discusses the design of an activity-based scenario, where the scenario is a collection of activities. Intelligent scenario directs in-game activity using dynamic rewards whose behavior is regulated using artificial intelligence with the Finite State Machine method. Then the resulting behavior is grouped into activity based on Appreciative Learning concept. Appreciative Learning is a concept in learning that focuses on positivity and an optimistic future. This concept consists of four stages, namely Discovery, Dream, Design, and Destiny. The intelligent scenario in this study is part of the Adaptive RPG For Education project, which contributes to the design of adaptive scenarios. Intelligent scenario produces an immersive experience in the form of activities with rewards that are conceptualized and synchronized between gaming and educational principles.},

Videogames are popular precisely because of the experience - games designed for learning can do no less. However, to be feasible for use in formal educational settings, they must do more, and while we are making progress studying games in classrooms, there remain few structured approaches to analysing games that do not include classroom testing. This paper outlines the author's Four Pillars of Game-Based Learning (4PEG) which can be used to perform a structured analysis of both COTS and serious games to assess whether or not a game has potential for use in the classroom.},

abstract={Matching tile games are an extremely popular game genre. Arguably the most popular iteration, Match-3 games, are simple to understand puzzle games, making them great benchmarks for research. In this paper, we propose developing different procedural personas for Match-3 games in order to approximate different human playstyles to create an automated playtesting system. The procedural personas are realized through evolving the utility function for the Monte Carlo Tree Search agent. We compare the performance and results of the evolution agents with the standard Vanilla Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation as well as to a random move-selection agent. We then observe the impacts on both the game's design and the game design process. Lastly, a user study is performed to compare the agents to human play traces.},

pages={2365-2369},
abstract={This work introduces the concept of critical sections for online first person shooter games (FPS). A critical section is a section of game-play which demands higher precision or tighter deadlines. Critical section traffic is more sensitive to network degradations than sections immediately preceding or following it. Critical sections provide game developers and network programmers a notion of relative priority of game traffic, and can identify segments whose preservation can lead to superior user perceived quality of playing FPS games on a network. By analyzing video-recordings of over 5 hours of FPS gameplay by 10 volunteers, we identify sections of FPS game-play whose degradation would cause inconsistent game-state updates resulting in user frustration. We observe that critical sections exhibit a pattern of occurrence and can account for upto 17% of game-play time. We next quantify the expected network induced degradations on critical sections for online FPS games on the Internet. Using traces from a deployment of FPS workloads on 50+ nodes in the Internet, we study network dynamics and their ensuing effect on critical sections. Using traces from this experiment, we derive the lower bound on potentially degraded game-play session on todays Internet. We argue that critical sections of FPS games can be preserved. This can allow a variety of network architectures to better deliver higher perceptual experience when deployed on the Internet. Overall, our results have implications for FPS game-design, network provisioning, and game quality evaluation.},

abstract={This survey explores procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML), defined as the generation of game content using machine learning models trained on existing content. As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content, such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content, such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, cocreativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks: long short-term memory networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models: $n$-grams and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in PCGML, including learning from small data sets, lack of training data, multilayered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.},

abstract={Teaching programming and algorithms is a big challenge, not only in universities but also in schools and training centers. Many proposals for stimulating this process were made in the last years. Previously to this work we had developed JPlay. The JPlay framework was proposed and developed for teaching programming with the development of simple 2D games. In this paper we propose a heuristic based on the structural analysis of the behaviors of a JPlay program and, based on this heuristic, we developed a tool that makes analyzes of JPlay programs, guiding and teaching a student for a specific game development. The heuristic consists on a comparison approach between the student program and the model program and it has four levels of analysis: the sequential code pattern of the JPlay, standardization model, the comparison of similar classes and construction of behavior trees of similar variables. Thus, the comparison consists on searching behaviors of correspondence between pairs of classes among these programs. In this paper we also present a review of results of BrickBreak game based on the source code of the integrated high school students in the course of Computers.},

abstract={Gameplay requirements are central to game development. In the business context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOGs) where game companies' revenues rely on players' monthly subscriptions, gameplay is also recognized as the key to player retention. However, information on what gameplay requirements are and how practitioners `engineer' them in real life is scarce. This exploratory study investigates how practitioners developing MMOGs reason about gameplay requirements and handle them in their projects. 12 practitioners from three leading MMOGs-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. The study's most important findings are that in MMOG projects: (1) gameplay requirements are co-created with players, (2) are perceived and treated by practitioners as sets of choices and consequences, (3) gameplay is endless within a MMOG, and while gameplay requirements do not support any game-end goal, they do support a level-end goal, (4) `paper-prototyping' and play-testing are pivotal to gameplay validation, (5) balancing the elements of the gameplay is an on-going task, perceived as the most difficult and labor-consuming, (6) gameplay happens both in-game and out-of-the game. We conclude with discussion on validity threats to our results and on implications for research and practice.},

The game focuses on specific learning objectives: the specification and analysis of requirements with user stories. BakeRE is the first game proposed to address these learning objectives. It is a multilevel puzzle game that can complement courses (traditional or on-line), such as a general software engineering or a specialized RE course. The player assembles user stories for a specific system by combining building blocks (roles, actions, benefits) from a predefined collection. As the player progresses through the levels, the difficulty increases. At the end of each level, learning feedback is provided to the player. Besides describing the game and its learning objectives, we present the game design process and outline in-progress research that aims to extend BakeRE through its embedding within an RE course.},

abstract={Maximizing product use is a central goal of many businesses, which makes retention and monetization two central analytics metrics in games. Player retention may refer to various duration variables quantifying product use: total playtime or session playtime are popular research targets, and active playtime is well-suited for subscription games. Such research often has the goal of increasing player retention or conversely decreasing player churn. Survival analysis is a framework of powerful tools well suited for retention type data. This paper contributes new methods to game analytics on how playtime can be measured using survival analysis. These methods include visualizations, metrics, and an AB-test based on the survival curve. All these methods work on censored data and enable computation of confidence intervals. This is especially important in time- and sample-limited data that occurs during game development. Throughout this paper, we illustrate the application of these methods to the development of the Hipster Sheep mobile game.},

abstract={Geogames are location-based games played in outdoor environments. Educators often use them to stimulate learning experiences in the context of field trips. When played in a new geographic environment, the games have to be adapted in a process called game relocation. While experienced game designers create the game mechanics of a Geogame, its relocation is generally left to non-designers, especially educators. This paper studies problems that arise when users without game-design experience relocate a Geogame. We identify common error types based on the game design documentation and recorded player data of four Geogames. We describe limitations of the heuristics currently used to avoid typical design errors (e.g. excessive total playing time). We finally show how an agent-based simulation helps to explore the design options available in Geogame relocation.},

abstract={This paper provides an extended gaming simulation framework and methods overview for the selection and development of situation awareness (SA) measurement techniques in gaming simulations. Gaming simulations are here defined as a simulation of a system through the use of gaming methods. Unlike SA measurements in human-in-the-loop simulators like cockpits, measurements for situation awareness in multi-actor gaming simulation environments are little investigated as a methodological approach. The aim of the framework is to bridge the gap between the theoretical implications of gaming simulations design elements and SA measurement techniques. Secondly, to provide key elements in game design and evaluation for the development of situation awareness measurement techniques. The framework is applied to determine a set of situation awareness measurement techniques for Dutch railway traffic controllers, in which the Dutch railway sector is increasingly using gaming simulation methods to investigate influences of new innovations for the railway system before innovations are put into the operations. Different sets of situation awareness measurement techniques for individuals and team/groups in railway traffic control are selected.},

abstract={Gamification incorporates game elements to make mundane activities more engaging. It has seen success in education, even more so when enhanced by gameful design. Among the elements of gameful design is narrative, which offers many benefits, such as contextualizing the learning process. However, there is currently a lack of guidelines on integrating narrative into a gameful learning process. This paper proposed a framework for narrative-based gameful learning processes, which connects a learning process' scenario and skill atoms to a narrative's plot and space. We validated the framework by implementing it to compose a narrative-based gameful course on game design, which we delivered through ClassCraft. We conducted a six-step process to compose the course, which resulted in a narrative graph with branchings for learning and narrative purposes. Ten Informatics students participated in the course, filled a questionnaire, and participated in a discussion. The questionnaire's results validate the course's effectiveness, and the discussion gathers insightful suggestions and critiques. Our analysis of the participants' game designs also proves the narrative's contextualization effect. We close this paper by discussing our results' limitations and directions for future studies.},

abstract={Successful serious games include a compelling narrative context and empirically validated pedagogical intervention methods. In order to create such games, design teams must consist of a multidisciplinary group of technical and pedagogical experts. In this paper, the authors show how the domain specific modeling language ATTAC-L facilitates communication between designers with different expertise, thus enabling and stimulating multidisciplinary collaboration. As a serious game design tool, ATTAC-L creates a link between the processes of pedagogical design and narrative modeling through its elaborate annotation system. As such, this modeling language enables designers to concentrate on aspects related to their field of expertise without losing oversight of the serious game as a whole. To support these tentative claims, the author present illustrations of how ATTAC-L is used in combination with a specific pedagogical design strategy (i.e. the Intervention Mapping Protocol) for the development of a serious game against cyber-bullying.},

abstract={Cybersecurity awareness and cyber skills training are vitally important and challenging. A huge number of attacks against everyday users occur routinely. Prevention techniques and responses are wide ranging but are only effective if used effectively. The objective of this research is to teach everyday users the requisite cybersecurity skills through gaming, beyond the current state of practice. Because the skill level of the trainees is also wide ranging, from causal computer users to software engineers to system administrators to managers, the games must also be capable of training this wide range of computer users. Computer games can provide a media for delivering training in an engaging format at levels appropriate for the individual trainees. In this paper we (1) describe the state of practice by describing the gaming tool used in most cyber challenges at high schools and colleges in the U.S, i.e., the cybersecurity gaming tool CyberNEXS™ (Science Applications International Corporation), (2) outline some of the additional topics that should be addressed in cybersecurity training and (3) note some other approaches to game design that might prove useful for future cybersecurity training game development beyond CyberNEXS.},

abstract={In this paper, collusion cooperation game theory is applied to optimize a linear passive vehicle suspension model with eight DOF, including six vertical and two rotation motions. Comprehensive considering road surface damage and ride comfort, taking stiffness and damping of seat and suspension system as design variables; and taking seat acceleration RMS, tire's relative dynamic load and suspension's maximum dynamic stroke as objective functions, we establish tri-objective optimization design model and present the optimal methods. Taking tri-objective as three players, by calculating the affecting factors of the design variables to objective functions and fuzzy clustering, the design variables are divided into different strategic spaces owned by each player. Adopting collusion cooperation game model and obeying “you're within me and I'm in yours” protocol, the absolute gains and relative gains are combined as the payoff functions of players. Each game player takes its payoff as mono-objective to optimize its own strategic spaces and obtains the best strategy to deal with the others. All the best strategies are combined as a game strategy set. By multi-gaming, the final solution meeting given convergence of criterion is obtained. From practical calculation example, tri-objective game design, the results prove this algorithm is effective.},

abstract={Exergames combine physical exercises and games. Thorough knowledge about the physical exercises is crucial in designing efficient exergames. Expert involvement in the design process, in this case with physiotherapists, is an efficient way to gather and retain domain specific knowledge for the design team. However, experts rarely have experience exploring design alternatives in a playful way, which is important when participating on the co-design of serious games like exergames. We explored the question: How can we involve experts to share and professionally explore their domain specific knowledge in a play-centric game design process? We present two co-design exergame workshops with physiotherapists. Based on lessons learned from the first workshop, we explored in the second workshop framing the entire workshop process as a game. We found that gamifying the workshop process into a design game provided a way to change the experts' effective-oriented mindset into a playful mindset. This article demonstrates some lessons learned from this process of creating and using such a method and proposes some directions for future research and applications.},

This preliminary data focus on a feasibility implementation of an assessment designed to embed these standards.

pages={256-267},
abstract={Multimedia social networks have been introduced as a new technology to enrich people's lives through enhanced multimedia distribution. On the other hand, a media cloud system can perform multimedia processing and storage, and provide heterogeneous multimedia services. However, the challenges still remain for end users (e.g., mobile devices and PCs) to receive multimedia streaming from the cloud system with satisfied quality-of-service (QoS). To address these challenges, an efficient multimedia distribution approach taking advantage of live-streaming social networks is innovated in this paper to deliver the media services from the cloud to both desktop and wireless end users. Our approach allows bandwidth limited mobile users to acquire live multimedia streaming from desktop users, directly based on their social relationships rather than from the cloud. When a number of mobile users compete for limited bandwidth access with the desktop users, a bandwidth allocation problem must be solved to meet all users' QoS requirements in the live-streaming social network. We formulate the problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which both desktop users and mobile users target at maximizing their utilities. In our study, a noncooperative game is used to model the competition among the desktop users in terms of shared bandwidth and price in the first stage of the game. The second stage of the game models the behavior of a mobile user selecting the desktop users by an evolutionary game. In addition, a case study is conducted following the general Stackelberg game formulation, where the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium is proved. Based on our game modeling, we design protocols for both desktop and mobile users and evaluate them with numerical examples.},

We present a case study of the proposed evaluation method with a detailed analysis of the game called JECRIPE, originally developed for stimulating cognitive abilities of children with Down syndrome in preschool age. The proposed method adopts qualitative and quantitative criteria to review the initial developmental factors that have driven JECRIPE's design versus the real behavior observed in a group of children playing the game.

abstract={Some curriculum of making computer games were developed to engage students in digital game-making activities so as to enhance their computational thinking skills during the last few years. The findings of those studies are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of computational thinking skills. However, many students seem to face difficulties in the processes of the game development, such as debugging, applying mathematics, or physics subjects. Additionally, students often have solved the problems and understood concepts, mainly math formulas and physics concepts, alone while creating their games. This study presents an innovative curriculum design that suggests two students playing different role to make motion-based touchless games (i.e., games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera or Leap Motion). Based on the requirements of the innovative curriculum and interaction technologies, students can naturally fulfill the ideal of pair programming and get various benefits from each other.},

Thus, this paper propose a new framework for the software developer to create new Serious Game for learning musical instrument. This paper discusses the notion of a SG schema and how pre-existing SG for musical practice can be used to provide design guidelines by developing a framework. Thus, SG developer for musical instrument game can easily map the learning aspects, describe software design, and describe ways to control them with new interfaces for musical expression. The framework is developed from analysis of several previous researches and associated to the game design process component of musical instrument. The framework has been implemented using three case studies of musical instrument (saron, kendhang, and angklung). Each components of the framework are mapped to the new case studies which produce three software game applications. Each application has been evaluated by 20 users. The result shows that the framework has been able to effectively and efficiently help game developer to create musical instrument game.},

abstract={The creative industries are facing tremendous changes due to fast development of new technologies, new stakeholder structures, more complex governance and a continuous demand for content due to new distribution channels. Despite these drastic changes, the creative industries want and need to preserve their cultural heritage to overcome volatility. A potential way for the creative industry to face these changes may be to transform creative projects towards agile project management. Due to the popularity and success of agility in project management in software domains, extant research details the benefits and challenges of agility and agile methods, but we lack a comprehensive picture of a possible integration of agility in creative industries. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the literature on agility and agile methods in the creative industries and develops a framework that focuses particularly on the audiovisual industries such as motion picture, music, mobile and video gaming industry. Based on our framework, we identified eleven specific drivers of agile project management for the creative industries within our 31 paper. Overall, our results identify a significant potential for future research on agile project management in creative industries and emphasize agility as an ‘accelerator’ of transformation.},

abstract={This paper describes a new evolutionary algorithm that is especially well suited to AI-Assisted Game Design. The approach adopted in this paper is to use observations of AI agents playing the game to estimate the game's quality. Some of best agents for this purpose are General Video Game AI agents, since they can be deployed directly on a new game without game-specific tuning; these agents tend to be based on stochastic algorithms which give robust but noisy results and tend to be expensive to run. This motivates the main contribution of the paper: the development of the novel N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm, where a model is used to estimate the fitness of unsampled points and a bandit approach is used to balance exploration and exploitation of the search space. Initial results on optimising a Space Battle game variant suggest that the algorithm offers far more robust results than the Random Mutation Hill Climber and a Biased Mutation variant, which are themselves known to offer competitive performance across a range of problems. Subjective observations are also given by human players on the nature of the evolved games, which indicate a preference towards games generated by the N-Tuple algorithm.},

abstract={The engineering disciplines are technical in nature, but that does not mean that engineers do not need to be creative. Engineering and science students could be asked to create new design ideas, but as they are still learning it might be bewildering for them to be confronted with too many choices. One solution might be to give them design constraints to help them focus their imaginations. In this study we asked students of game development to create small game designs, with or without extra constraints. They found it difficult to follow the constraints when asked to do so; and yet their creativity did not suffer when they did. The game designs were evaluated for creativity, novelty and quality, by a professor in the subject, but also by all the students themselves. The students were able to produce some creative designs, although some struggled to do so in the brief time they had. In peer assessment, they achieved good consistency amongst themselves, but diverged somewhat from the expert evaluator. The strongest performing students, however, also produced the most creative game ideas. This gives us confidence that both the creation and peer assessment exercises are worthwhile and informative, and potentially could benefit the students as they learn their discipline.},

abstract={Petri nets are graphical and mathematical tool for modeling, analyzing and designing discrete event applicable to many systems. They can be applied to game design too, especially to design of serous game. Mastery learning is the core of the learning process in serious game. Mastery learning can be achieved by always maintaining a high interest. Indirectly, CSG always observe fluctuations in interest of the players. To asses the cognitive level of player ability, we propose a Cognitive Skill Game (CSG). CSG improves this cognitive concept to monitor how players interact with the game. This game employs Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) for optimizing the cognitive skill input classification of the player. CSG may provide information when a player needs help or when wanting a formidable challenge. The game will provide the appropriate tasks according to players' ability. CSG will help balance the emotions of players, so players do not get bored and frustrated. Players have a high interest to finish the game if the player is emotionally stable. Interests in the players strongly support the procedural learning in a serious game.},

abstract={Gamification have been used in various fields to attract and engage users by using game design elements or characteristics in non-game context. It has been introduced in education field, especially higher education level in past two to three years ago. There is limited evidence, however, about the effectiveness of gamification in classroom teaching and learning process. Thus, an exploratory study is carried out to collect participants' views on the potential of gamified classroom via Prezi, a cloud-based presentation software, as a means of supporting teaching and learning in higher education level. Participants in this study were 46 foundation students from a local higher education institution. The analysis data will uncover to what extend students with different background knowledge differ in their perception of gamified classroom via Prezi. A high percentage -93.48% of the students agree that they can learn via this approach on digital devices such as laptop and smartphones. 86.96% students agree that they are engaged and immersed in learning via this method. Furthermore, 84.78% students feel curious to explore the lecture content and are able to focus on what they are going to learn in the class. At last, the findings of the study will propose an alternative and innovative approach to improve teaching and learning process in higher education level via gamified classroom.},

abstract={Integrating games into learning process can be summarized into three approaches: (1) Using multimedia technologies to content presentation for edutainment purpose, (2) repurposing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) games to assisting in learning for educational purpose, and (3) a hybrid way to design specific games that seeks a balance between fun and educational content. In this paper, we propose a compromised platform which enables instructors to create a learning game by an authoring tool. The reason is that many learning games developed for specific curriculums are time-consuming and high-cost. Additionally, instructors may be unfamiliar or have no experience with game design and programming. Therefore, the developed system, Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game-based Learning System, consists of three major components: game editor, learning content management component and game rendering engine, which can provide instructors to create different games for multiple curriculums.},

abstract={The number of available educational games has enormously grown and it is difficult for users to identify which games are pedagogically effective among the multitude of options in app marketplaces. Recent studies on math games have highlighted the importance of (1) linking learning attributes and gameplay and (2) game design that supports students' deliberate practise. Using these as a measure for pedagogical quality, we investigated 109 math games found on Google Play Store (n=61) and iOS App Store (n=48). Furthermore, monetization solutions, data use permissions, target age group and type of mathematical content were retrieved from the apps. The analysis showed that only 11,0% of the games integrated learning attributes with gameplay and 12,0% of the games contained tasks which support learners' deliberate practice. The most commonly featured math subject was arithmetic and the games were targeted mostly to early childhood (6-12 years). Finally, games following curricula content and recommended design principles were difficult to locate using the search tools of the app marketplaces.},

We draw on the design science literature to develop a serious game evaluation framework that emphasizes grounding evaluation in each of four key areas-theoretical, technical, empirical, and external. We further recommend that serious game developers assume an iterative, adaptive approach to grounding an evaluation effort in these four areas, emphasizing some areas more than others at different stages of the development cycle. We illustrate our framework using a case study of a large-scale serious game development project. The case study illustrates a holistic approach to serious game evaluation that is valuable to both researchers and practitioners.},

abstract={Computer games, as a form of interactive media, invoke emotions and feelings in gamers. These emotional and psychological effects resulting from game play affect the gaming experience, both positively and negatively. Earlier studies identified danger as an important element of gaming, where gamers are challenged and engage in intense emotional and psychological experiences. However, the element of danger can be detrimental when strong emotions are invoked and penalties are imposed on gamers, leading to an inconsistent gaming experience. In this study, we analyze how Runescape, a massive multiplayer online game balances the danger elements by introducing safety features in an important aspect of the game - trading. Trading scams in Runescape were prevalent before safety elements were implemented, leading to the breach of trust and negative consequences for the gamers. Through trade policing and balance, trade scams are minimized, and gamers can safely trade with one another, immersing themselves in the represented reality without suffering from detrimental emotional consequences. From the analysis of Runescape, we propose three guidelines to suggest how to balance in-game safety and danger for future game development.},

We continue by presenting a set of guidelines to be applied to the game design in order to adjust the rehabilitation routine to patients that have relevant values on the mentioned traits while also taking into account their past experience in the rehabilitation process. Finally, we consider a serious game for health focused on upper-limb rehabilitation and we project two scenarios on how the guidelines can be applied to the game in order to improve the rehabilitation for patients.},

year={2014},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={This article aims at empirically validating the Comparative Transformational Model (CTM) in the realm of healthcare. The model compares two different learning situations, one using Serious Games, the other one using conventional ways of learning. Because the application of freshly learned knowledge is fundamental for any change of behavior (e.g. in business processes) the model can be applied to any cogitable process change. The CTM will be combined with the Serious Game Design Assessment Framework (SGDAF) as stressed by the learning theorists Konstantin Mitgutsch and Narda Alvarado [4]. By testing the models' applicability in terms of the CTM itself as well as of the combination with the SGDAF, it is not only elaborated whether the examined Serious Games (SGs) are an economically valuable alternative to classical transformation processes. Also, an answer will be given to the question how the (first six, later eight) design components should be rated and whether the melted model is complete as it stands. The analysis raises the question, whether the CTM and the SGDAF respect the inevitable influencing factors like for example personality for whether they need adaptation and if so, which. Three healthcare SGs will be evaluated in order to indicatively calculate whether the single-step classical way of change management (A) is more effective than the sum of the three steps (B1, B2, B3) taken in the SG detour. The same will be done with the SGDAF. Finally, it will be reflected upon the question whether the outcome, an eight-elements-chart, is universally valid, meaning whether it might serve as an omniuseful tool for the assessment of any SG.},

Scrum principles are easy to understand, but its different roles, artifacts and meetings need to be trained in practice to ensure participants act appropriately in the course of a larger project. We report on a gamification (or game-based learning) approach to train Scrum to electrical engineering and computer science students using the Minecraft game. The main motivation of the idea is to concentrate on the agile framework itself instead of on software development or engineering issues. In this paper, we describe two teaching periods with approximately 110 students in total at a university of applied sciences. We modified the setup in the second run. We compare the two versions and present a critical discussion including findings and lessons learned from the teaching experiments.},

abstract={Researchers in serious games area and professionals in stroke rehabilitation, working collaboratively in explorative interdisciplinary research studies in order to develop usable and effective applications. In this context, physiotherapists and occupational therapy are important elements of stroke rehabilitation. Applications from such exploratory development reflect motivational and easy to use features, which could be further designed and developed by serious games developers. This research study aims to investigate the role and usefulness of Video Capture Virtual Reality Technology (VCVRT) in motor impairment rehabilitation, to identify and explore the importance of this technology in healthcare, specifically in motor impairment rehabilitation. Likewise, to analyze the acceptance of VCVRT among the physiotherapists in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived intension to use. Results imply that video capture virtual reality technology can be use as complement to conventional physiotherapy. This technology is cheap, easy to use and is useful as a home based rehabilitation tool, but together with physiotherapist supervision or coaching. Moreover, VCVRT is motivational for weak patients and useful in motor rehabilitation in terms of quantity, i.e. intensity of exercise can be increased. Physiotherapist centered approach is necessary for game design process; effective game design suggestions and the idea of single gaming framework consists of different games acquiring multiple rehabilitation goals, are achieved from physiotherapists during the research. Technology acceptance value is high among physiotherapists. The research study provides a more detailed understanding of the factors involved in the implication of video capture virtual reality technology in motor impairment rehabilitation.},

abstract={Arguably the grand goal of artificial intelligence research is to produce machines with general intelligence: the capacity to solve multiple problems, not just one. Artificial intelligence (AI) has investigated the general intelligence capacity of machines within the domain of games more than any other domain given the ideal properties of games for that purpose: controlled yet interesting and computationally hard problems. This line of research, however, has so far focused solely on one specific way of which intelligence can be applied to games: playing them. In this paper, we build on the general game-playing paradigm and expand it to cater for all core AI tasks within a game design process. That includes general player experience and behavior modeling, general non-player character behavior, general AI-assisted tools, general level generation and complete game generation. The new scope for general general game AI beyond game-playing broadens the applicability and capacity of AI algorithms and our understanding of intelligence as tested in a creative domain that interweaves problem solving, art, and engineering.},

abstract={Human playtesting is a useful step in the game development process, but involves high economic costs and is time-consuming. While playtesting through artificial intelligence is gaining attention, it is challenging to analyze the collected data. We address the challenge by proposing visualizations to derive insights about level design in 2D side-scrolling games. To focus on the navigation behavior in the level design, we study the trajectories of computer agents trained using artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing a web-based prototype and presenting the insights gained from the visualizations for the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2. We highlight lessons learned and directions to customize the approach for other analysis goals of playtesting.},

abstract={Serious games have the potential to complement existing teaching methods by motivating and providing a more enjoyable experience for the players or by simulating events that would be otherwise difficult to reproduce in the classroom. Despite their potential, little is known about how the games could be used not only for teaching but also as assessment tools. This research addresses this gap. We present an in-game assessment method which assesses the learning objectives included in the game without the need for a separate intervention. We evaluate the proposed method and we show that there is no statistically significant difference in participants being assessed through a questionnaire outside the game and the integrated game assessment method. Moreover, we looked at whether the player experience has been affected by the changes needed in the game design and the players' preferences for different types of assessment. Most participants preferred being assessed through the game. They also felt that the assessment has overall improved their game experience.},

abstract={In order to be prepared for careers in todays global economy, software engineering students need to understand the issues, methods, and practices associated with Global Software Development (GSD). One approach to teaching GSD is to conduct a GSD project class involving student teams from different institutions in different countries. This approach has the advantage of giving students first-hand experience with the barriers to collaboration and other issues faced by software development teams engaged in GSD. However, this approach is resource-intensive and requires cooperation among institutions. This paper presents an alternate approach based on game design, where students learn GSD concepts by developing a GSD simulation game. Following this approach, students learn about GSD through implementing a game engine that simulates the effects of global distance on a distributed software project. The experience shows that students seem to grasp the concepts and issues as a side effect of implementing the game.},

Being able to evaluate the core game mechanics early during production is useful to improve the quality of a game, and ultimately, player satisfaction. A current problem with automated game evaluation via AI is to define measurable parameters that correlate to the quality of the game mechanics. We apply the Information Theory based concept of “Relevant Information” to this problem and argue that there is a relation between enjoyment related game-play properties and Relevant Information for an AI playing the game. We also demonstrate, with a simple game implementation, a.) how an adaptive AI can be used to approximate the Relevant Information, b.) how those measurable numerical values relate to certain game design flaws c.) how this knowledge can be used to improve the game.},

Such knowledge could be the unique game logic. This paper reports realized approaches to derivate infrastructure from that logic within our middleware. Getting through this is achieved by using an abstract meta model for game design processes, harvest information from those design results and generate infrastructure for communication, controlling and persistence. Finally we evaluates its applicableness and usability in multiple game projects.},

abstract={Overweight and obesity pose a serious and increasing problem worldwide. Current treatment methods can result in weight loss in the short term but often fail in the longer term. Increasing motivation and thereby improving adherence can be a key factor in achieving the needed behavioral change. One approach is to address affective state (i.e. to promote positive emotions) by making people aware of their condition in a playful manner, possibly with peer interaction. Serious gaming is envisioned as one way to achieve this. Based on a study of the scientific evidence, the serious game `Healthy Weight Game!' was designed. The design incorporates most of the features shown to be beneficial in the scientific literature. An evaluation of the design involving a survey of 53 subjects produced positive results. The game was well understood and seen as a good method to help people lose weight and induce positive behavioral change. It was seen as a good addition to own initiatives for being physically active and as a useful addition to dieting and physical therapy. The design of the game (appearance and content) was positively received. Some gender differences were found in reactions to features such as visualization of goal achievements (e.g. avatar getting thinner as exercise goals are reached) and the kind of informative feedback which was appreciated. Overall the game design was rated 7.57/10 over all respondents. We conclude that this design demonstrates potential for improving physical and, indirectly, mental health of people facing overweight and obesity by increasing adherence and promoting sustainable behavioral change. Next steps are to implement the game and conduct a larger scale evaluation.},

abstract={Despite the popularity of MOOCs in providing opportunities for socialization, collaboration, and professional improvement, there has been little research exploring them in the context of Software Engineering Education (SEE). The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of practices and challenges when developing academic software engineering MOOCs. To this end, we research (i) how MOOCs in SEE are designed and (ii) what learning design considerations educators and learning designers have when developing SEE-related MOOCs. To address the first research question, a systematic mapping is performed to outline the current landscape. The second research question is answered by analyzing and reflecting on practical experiences acquired during the design of a MOOC on Agile Software Development. The design of the course was based on the Pedagogical Design Pattern Framework for MOOCs, an approach to design for learning that was defined in our previous studies. For this course, two environments were considered: (a) course-time on the Tim Tec MOOC platform for deeper engagement with active learning activities, such as Project-based learning; (b) a Facebook group as a social and collaborative learning space, including scenarios based on problem-based learning to activate prior knowledge. Some of the pedagogical strategies adopted to motivate self-regulated learning included self-introduction video, diary, diagnostic self-assessments, development of small projects alone and in pairs. Our findings provide evidence that there are still several technological and pedagogical challenges that need to be addressed so as to enhance the MOOCs learning experience for SEE. Technological issues identified include the development of tools and educational games, which should be integrated into MOOCs, and the use of learning analytics to support motivation, user experience, and more active learning in specific topics, such as Project Management, Agile Methods, and Requirements Engineering. In turn, the most significant and needed improvement to the pedagogical aspects is a re-thinking of the virtual moment in the MOOC platform so as to optimize it through activities that promote active learning and contextualized assessments.},

abstract={Playtesting is a lifecycle phase in game development wherein the completeness and smooth progress of planned content are verified before release of a new game. Although studies on playtesting in Match 3 games have attempted to utilize Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the applicability of these methods are limited because the associated training is time-consuming and data collection is difficult. To address this problem, game playtesting was performed via learning based on strategic play in Match 3 games. Five strategic plays were defined in the Match 3 game under consideration and game playtesting was performed for each situation via reinforcement learning. The proposed agent performed within a 5% margin of human performance on the most complex mission in the experiment. We demonstrate that it is possible for the level designer to measure the difficulty of the level via playtesting various missions. This study also provides level testing standards for several types of missions in Match 3 games.},

abstract={War gaming is a tool to enhance human decision-making acumen during actual war time. War games are analytic games that simulate warfare at the tactical, operational or strategic level. They are used to analyze war fighting concepts, train and prepare commanders and subordinates, explore scenarios and evaluate how planning affects outcomes. Such simulations are very useful to develop tactical, strategic and doctrinal solutions. It also provides the participants with insight into decision making process and stress management. Our paper presents a framework that supports an aerial war game simulation in which two opposing forces (red and blue) participate and follow rules and strategies depicting an actual or real life situation. War is emulated and commanders and other officers perform war duties without any troops involved in this training. Our paper presents a proposal of aerial warfare training through simulation and discusses the nature of war gaming, its uses, underlying architecture and the functional modules visualized with their roles, game design i.e. the various stages into which the whole war game has been split and explains the states of the missions being planned by teams to accomplish the objectives given to them. Also, the paper addresses the implementation level details and overview of future scope visualized.

abstract={The design of the control mechanisms for the agents of modern video games is one of the main tasks involved in the game design process. This task grows in complexity as either the number of different game agents or the number of possible actions increase. An alternative mechanism to avoid hard-coding of agent controllers is the use of learning mechanisms to construct these controllers. These learning mechanisms can be applied during a development phase of the game, making agents learn the best sequence of actions under different circumstances. One of the learning techniques commonly used is reinforcement learning and in particular Q-learners. This paper presents an alternative method to combine genetic algorithms and Q-Learners for stochastic games. The results, using a video game scenario, show that the combination of learning and evolving Q-learner matrices outperforms the sole learning mechanism, independently of the number of learning evaluations.},

abstract={The development of an online game requires not only the content, visual and auditory design but also a considerable amount of effort for planning, creating and operating the infrastructure for exchanging information between players and backend. Within the context of building an own browser-based massively multiplayer online game, questions like how information of this kind can be exchanged arise. Within this paper, various strategies were planned, developed and evaluated to provide the helpful basis for a platform decision. These strategies do not feel very “game-like”. As a result of this, we created an alternative approach as a runtime environment for games of this kind, which has to simplify the conventional strategies for making games: our GameEngine. This environment combines code generation for clients, automated data transformation, platform independent remote procedure calls and lifecycle management for entities. This paper targets to outline the different strategies for game realisation, and analyses the efforts in comparison to our approach in various applications. Proprietary TCP-based approaches are taken into account, as well as standardised web technologies and currently available runtime environments for game development. All approaches indicated a significant increase in effort for the implementation of various examples. An additional effort that can be nearly avoided, and is achieved with our approach.},

Using GBL as an educational strategy we managed to make the game, a software, transparent. That is we made the inner processes of the game known to the students. As such, besides learning by playing, students had access to the game design, through intentional modeling. We collected evidence that, by disclosure of the information about the design, students better performed on learning software engineering.},

abstract={The risk of failure of software development projects has been high for decades. One main reason identified by empirical studies is that the requirement specifications have gaps at the start of the project. Research on requirement analysis and project management primarily focuses on the improvement of methods and the behavior of the project participants. In our study, we suggest switching to the contracting level, describing the interaction of the involved organizations in terms of game theory. Organizations pursue economic targets. As we will show, the customer and the supplier are in a dilemma situation regarding the effort for closing the gaps in the requirement specifications. This results in a high risk for the quality of the software system. In support of our theoretical argument, we carried out an empirical investigation that shows that gaps in requirements and conflicts in the project exist of nearly every project. The most commonly used contract model is a fixed-price contract. From our model, we can derive suggestions for the contract design of software development projects as well as for the cooperation behavior during the project.},

abstract={Behavioral datasets from major commercial game titles of the “AAA” grade generally feature high dimensionality and large sample sizes, from tens of thousands to millions, covering time scales stretching into several years of real-time, and evolving user populations. This makes dimensionality-reduction methods such as clustering and classification useful for discovering and defining patterns in player behavior. The goal from the perspective of game development is the formation of behavioral profiles that provide actionable insights into how a game is being played, and enables the detection of e.g. problems hindering player progression. Due to its unsupervised nature, clustering is notably useful in cases where no prior-defined classes exist. Previous research in this area has successfully applied clustering algorithms to behavioral datasets from different games. In this paper, the focus is on examining the behavior of 62,000 players from the major commercial game Tomb Raider: Underworld, as it unfolds from the beginning of the game and throughout the seven main levels of the game. Where previous research has focused on aggregated behavioral datasets spanning an entire game, or conversely a limited slice or snapshot viewed in isolation, this is to the best knowledge of the authors the first study to examine the application of clustering methods to player behavior as it evolves throughout an entire game.},

abstract={A crucial aspect to game development is the ability to establish the player emersion in a simulated and virtual world, presenting engaging content and maximizing the gaming experience. The demand for new and hand-customized content keeps increasing, in playable maps that are ever expanding in size, without compromising quality or differentiation. The usage of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) allows computers to generate game content and produce distinguishable and unique instances amongst the ones generated allowing to better replicate reality and deliver intricate systems without the costs and time consumption of human intervention.As a key element for the appeal of many games, natural life exhibits both complex and distinguishable behaviors, from species to species as well as from individual to individual. Biodiversity is maintained by processes operating over broader spatial and temporal scales, and as such, simulating plant diversity is a process better suited to operate under PCG algorithms.In this study, we describe a procedural flora evolution algorithm that can replicate a flora species life cycle for a practical 3D game setting (Universe 51), using scientific knowledge to better reproduce such intricate behaviors. We based some part our approach on complex intelligence algorithms, as well as in some original processes targeted at our project specificities. The evolution algorithm starts with the end results of a flora generation algorithm that can create millions of different flora species based on selected biological parameters. This data is then interpreted by the evolutionary algorithm, that uses these values to determine each species survival chances in the surrounding environment. Our results were able to replicate and autonomously manage plant species life cycle, under a dynamic environment with potentially varying conditions.},

abstract={Predicting how much effort will be required to complete a software project as early as possible is a very important factor in the success of software development projects. Including function points and its variants, there are several size measures and corresponding measurement methods that can be used for effort estimation. However, in most of the projects, there is limited amount of information available in the early stages and significant effort is spent for size measurement and effort estimation with such methods. This paper analyzes the correlation between the size metrics of conceptual model of the problem domain and the resulting software. For this purpose, we consider open source project management and game software. We apply linear regression and cross validation techniques to investigate the relation between the sizes of problem domain (i.e., Conceptual) and solution domain (i.e., Design) models. The results reveal a high correlation between the number of conceptual classes in the problem domain model and the number of software classes constituting the corresponding software. The results suggest that it is possible to use problem domain descriptions in the early stages of software development projects to make plausible predictions for the size of the software.},

abstract={Linked lists play an important role in learning basic Computer Science (CS) concepts among a number of different data structures. They are the basis for more complex data structures such as tree data structures. Recursion, stacks and queues can be effectively implemented using linked lists. We observe over the years that our students struggle with linked lists more than some other data structures. While students understand the concepts of stack and queue data structures faster, they need more time to understand and visualize the linked list and its operation algorithms. This paper presents a game-like instructional module called Space Traveler that aims to assist students to better understand and master the concepts of linked lists. Four CS undergraduate students developed it using GameMaker Studio in three months. The Space Traveler game looks like a classic snake game. The game supports practicing the linked list operations such as insertion, search and deletion. This paper presents the game design and implementation in detail and shares our experiences using this module in the CSC2331 Data Structure class at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) in 2014. This module has been refined based on the feedback from students and instructors. The refined version will be used again in the upcoming semesters. A pretest, a posttest and a survey were developed and used in the evaluation process. In addition, a lab assignment was designed to accompany the game module. Initial assessment outcomes showed very promising student improvements as a result of the use of this game module in the classroom. The module has been made available online to benefit students at other institutions.},

abstract={Game programmers rely on artificial intelligence techniques to encode characters' behaviors initially specified by game designers. Although significant efforts have been made to assist their collaboration, the formalization of behaviors remains a time-consuming process during the early stages of game development. We propose an authoring tool allowing game designers to formalize, visualize, modify, and validate game level solutions in the form of automatically generated storyboards. This system uses planning techniques to produce a level solution consistent with gameplay constraints. The main planning agent corresponds to the player character, and the system uses the game actions as planning operators and level objectives as goals to plan the level solutions. Generated solutions are presented as 2-D storyboards similar to comic strips. We present in this paper the first version of a fully implemented prototype as well as examples of generated storyboards, adapted from the original design documents of the blockbuster game Hitman.},

abstract={It is paramount for software engineers to develop the skills and background necessary to effectively work, communicate and innovate on an international scale. Our growing global world needs an increasingly diverse workforce. The effects of the globalization have been felt in the software engineering arena through software engineering projects realized by diverse professionals located in different continents with different industrial background, culture, time zone, and even language. During 2014 and 2015, Kennesaw State University (KSU) faculty from Marietta, GA, USA traveled to La Salle University in Arequipa, Peru to deliver special Software Engineering (SWE) winter programs. The programs provided opportunities to study the student's understanding of software engineering terms, knowledge, and practices in two different international arenas, KSU and La Salle. This paper discusses details and results of the winter programs executed by KSU bi-lingual faculty to La Salle participants with limited English understanding. A cycle of knowledge building emerged from the two cultures in the preparation and execution of the courses. The student participants aligned their knowledge and understanding of their Latin American software engineering practices to the new perspective given in the program. The experience educated faculty and participants of the agreements, differences, and challenges to the software architecture and game development curriculum, terminology, and development trends. The process of the collaborative knowledge distribution and assimilation that was built and experienced in the courses was surveyed with the student's views about pre-understandings, personal comprehension, opinions and final assimilation of the course content.},

abstract={I have had the opportunity to serve as a reviewer on several National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program panels in the subject areas of information technology and education applications. The SBIR/STTR program is a unique opportunity for entrepreneurs to get funding for exciting, potentially lucrative products in digital media. Funding is provided for innovative and risky projects that push the boundaries of existing technologies. The program seeks specifically to fund ambitious, entrepreneurial companies that have developed new products for which there is a demonstrated market. Successful phase I grantees are then eligible for phase II grants, which can total more than US$1 million. However, many in the game development community are either unaware of the existence of this funding opportunity or they have little experience in writing good grant proposals. In my experience, the quality of the proposals submitted for funding in this area is lower than the quality of proposals in other areas such as human-computer interaction or user interface design. The goal of this article is to provide information about the program and help authors write solid proposals so that excellent ideas from the game development community can get funded.},

abstract={As the educational organizations worldwide are moving towards bringing education experience on Internet, via Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on Massive Open Online Education Platforms (MOOEPs), the retention of the enrolled students throughout the course is still a huge challenge. Although the online education has an immensely noble aim, i.e., to provide free\less expensive quality education to everyone, but if the existing MOOCs are upgraded to more captivating environment for users, a drastic increase in the user engagement in the course can be achieved, and hence MOOCs' providers can reach their ultimate goal in a more ubiquitous manner. In this paper it is suggested that this divide between a MOOC and user's engagement can be bridged with Gamification. Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. Here an experimental environment was setup to compare the results of a small vocabulary course distributed among 100 candidates, and a comparative analysis between the gamified learning method and conventional learning method has been done. After the completion of the course a small survey was also taken from the candidates who had gamified tool. The results show that if the learning platform is gamified, it does not only drastically increase the user enrolment but also increase user engagement throughout the course. Gamification also makes learning, a unique and amusing experience.},

abstract={Creating a mobile urban tourism storytelling application presents several interactivity challenges on how to convey an engaging multimedia experience on-site. This article describes a methodology for fast prototyping of a multimedia mobile applications dedicated to urban tourism storytelling. The application can be a game that takes advantage of several location-based technologies, freely available geo-referenced media, and augmented reality for immersive gameplay. The goal is to create serious games for tourism that follow a main narrative but where the story can automatically adapt itself to the current location of the player, assimilate possible detours and allow posterior out-of-location playback. Adaptable stories can use dynamic information from map sources such as points of interest (POI), elevation or virtual buildings. The main focus is for these location-based storytelling games to create more engagement between the tourists and the urban environment. To explore this concept, an application was designed for the city of Porto: Unlocking Porto. This location-based game with a central, yet adaptable, story engages the player into the main sights following an augmented reality path while playing small games. The article discusses and presents solutions for media acquisition, interactive storytelling, game-design interface and multi-disciplinary coordination for mobile app development.},

abstract={This paper presents the “Multi-Role Project” method (MRP), a broadly applicable project-based learning method, and describes its implementation and evaluation in the context of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) course. The MRP method is designed around a meta-principle that considers the project learning activity as a role-playing game based on two projects: a learning project and an engineering project. The meta-principle is complemented by five principles that provide a framework to guide the working practices of student teams: distribution of responsibilities; regular interactions and solicitations within the team; anticipation and continuous improvement; positive interdependence and alternating individual/collective work; and open communication and content management. This paper presents the implementation of MRP in a course teaching software engineering, UML language, and project management. The results show that MRP helped the course's students to acquire important professional knowledge and skills, experience near-real-world professional realities, and develop their abilities to work both in teams and autonomously.},

abstract={Human-Computer Interaction topics have been previously used to motivate and attract students to the field of Computer Science. However, as students are growing up in contact with several interactive computational devices, one could suspect that they already possess an empirical, informal knowledge about the quality of some specific types of human-computer interfaces. This informal knowledge may influence how these students deal with the construction of interactive artifacts while learning programming fundamentals. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed a Game Design Workshop to be offered to high school students. Based on the results of its first offering, we identified that issues related to displaying the game status and score, response time of controls and graphical and sound features were quite relevant to students. Students added additional features to solve those issues in a spontaneous way. An analysis of the developed games indicates that, in order to implement the additional features, students had to learn and apply programming concepts that were new to them, such as loop boundaries and message broadcasting.},

abstract={Stroke is a major cause of severe physical disability, leading into a variety of impairments. In general, stroke rehabilitation is a process which requires intensive direct physical therapy and is usually guided by physiotherapists. The long and intensive therapy sessions often results in patients losing the motivation to continue with the therapy, and as a result patients do not recover to their prospective. With increasing occurrence of stroke incidence, therapists are under pressure for time. At present most of the rehabilitation programmes are highly human intensive. Thus an innovative game technology that supports stroke rehabilitation may provide new opportunities. The main objective of this paper is to present a new low cost game framework for stroke rehabilitation programme that would increase patients' motivation for therapy, and also to study the feasibility and effect of a new game based technology to support hand and leg rehabilitation. In this paper, some important new game design principles for hand and leg rehabilitation with a standard angle based representation of the full body motion during exercise, for improving the accuracy of stroke exercise are presented. The design of serious games, with important game design principle frequently linked with worthy user engagement, may offer perceptions into how more effective systems can be developed for stroke rehabilitation. The additional bio-signal and online database will enable evaluation of patient s movement performance.},

And then got a vision of life enlightenment as related as philosophy of Buddhism in the visualization of the Borobudur temple. Basically, this spiritual experience will be developed as main concept of the game design with virtual reality technology. The whole idea of this study is investigating the contribution of spiritual element of the Borobudur to the aesthetics of interaction. However, this paper focuses on preliminary of the practice-led research methodology of VR Borobudur art creation. Exploratory hypothesis is the spiritual of life enlightenment could be employed as contents of digital game of VR Borobudur. The end of the project will use the VR Borobudur for play test observation as one of method to investigating the contribution of the aesthetics of interaction in the game with virtual reality technology. In initial summary, the researcher estimates the design method of interactive digital arts creation based on religious substance need more depth understanding in synthesis of spiritual philosophy and cultural studies.},

abstract={This paper attempts to give a high-level overview of the field of artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: 1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; 2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and 3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.},

abstract={This paper studies the incentive-driven service provisioning framework for multi-broker orchestrated multi-domain software-defined elastic optical networks (SD-EONs). We first model the incentive-driven service provisioning paradigm as a noncooperative game, where the brokers compete with each other for inter-domain provisioning tasks. A kernel density estimation (KDE) based intelligent bidding strategy is presented for the brokers to decide the optimal service prices. To overcome the drawbacks of noncooperative game modeling, we further discuss the cooperative marketing strategy for the brokers and present a collision-aware Nash bargaining method to facilitate Pareto-efficient provisioning tasks partitioning among the brokers. Simulation results indicate that the KDE-based bidding strategy effectively improves the broker profit in the noncooperative scenario, while the cooperative game-theoretic approach can resolve the issues in the noncooperative game modeling to enable much higher broker profit without sacrificing the interests of domain managers.},

abstract={There are many training methods applied using video game as a medium to improve user motivation in training. Besides its game design, the setting of difficulty level also affects user motivation. If a game is too difficult, its player will be stressful. And if it's too easy, its player will be bored quickly. A game must balance player's skill and challenge provided in it. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a technique used to adjust difficulty level in a game with its player's skill, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Algorithm. Monte Carlo Tree Search can be applied by using AI DDA agent to convert option policy and playout evaluation heuristically. It is applied to balance the difficulty level with player's skill. A test has been carried out by testing AI DDA agent's accuracy and comparing the effects of every difficulty level strategy in a balance training game with wooble board-based. Its result shows that AI DDA agent is able to adjust difficulty level with 82% accuracy. However, the strategy comparison of difficulty level has no significant difference, but one of the parameters, i.e. Health Point, shows that the game can adjust difficulty level with player's skill.},

abstract={Video games have increasingly demonstrated a great deal of audiovisual realism, in par with the massive performance improvement of computer systems. At the same time, their Artificial Intelligence (AI) component falls short in terms of realism because it is usually based on non-adaptive methods. Adaptive AI mechanisms can help increase video game realism allowing the game to adapt in real-time to the game progress and the user behavior. Following a short overview of the progress of AI in video games in the past years, this paper highlights the creation of modern video games with basic and elementary adaptive game AI using the Unity game development framework. Particular emphasis is on the details of the AI component. First, a shooter game with basic AI is created. Finally, an action-adventure video game is created featuring elementary case-based adaptive AI. The objective in this game is to create enemies which are able to perceive changes in the environment and adapt their strategies accordingly. Proposed AI practices can migrate into relevant real world applications, such as video surveillance and intrusion detection systems, mission critical autonomous networked patrolling and/or save and rescue robots, vision and hearing assistive applications, intelligent video and behavioral analytics to detect and predict threats etc.},

abstract={One of the challenges during game development is to find a way on how to make the players actually enjoy the game itself while being quite hooked by its gameplay. In almost in every game, player must play the game through challenges to complete the game's main objectives. Enjoyment is highest when the game's challenges, which are either hard-coded or adaptively put forth by AI, are of appropriate difficulty with respect to the player's skill. In order to balance out between these two aspects, a difficulty adjustment is needed. In this paper, we study an application of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MTCS) for creating such a balancing using role playing games as the case study. The key idea is the intuition that a game's difficulty is balanced if any of the player or the AI can win or lose the game by only a small margin. We conduct experiment to see if the method is appropriate for this problem.},

abstract={Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several studies have reported that periods of “crunch time” are prevalent in the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration, minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities. Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic “crunch time” and argue that game jam organizers are in a good position to problematize the phenomenon.},

abstract={In current IaaS cloud markets, tenant consumers non-cooperatively compete for cloud resources via demand quantities, and the service quality is offered in a best effort manner. To better exploit tenant demand correlation, cloud brokerage services provide cloud resource multiplexing so as to earn profits by receiving volume discounts from cloud providers. A fundamental but daunting problem facing a tenant consumer is competitive resource procurements via cloud brokerage. In this paper, we investigate this problem via non-cooperative game modeling. In the static game, to maximize the experienced surplus, tenants judiciously select optimal demand responses given pricing strategies of cloud brokers and complete information of the other tenants' demands. We also derive Nash equilibrium of the non-cooperative game for competitive resource procurements. Performance evaluation on Nash equilibrium reveals insightful observations for both theoretical analysis and practical cloud resource procurements scheme design.},

abstract={The design of the control mechanisms for the agents in modern video games is one of the main tasks involved in the game design process. Designing controllers grows in complexity as either the number of different game agents or the number of possible actions increase. An alternative mechanism to hard-coding agent controllers is the use of learning techniques. This paper introduces two new variants of a hybrid algorithm, named WEREWoLF and WERESARSA, that combine evolutionary techniques with reinforcement learning. Both new algorithms allow a group of different reinforcement learning controllers to be recombined in an iterative process that uses both evolution and learning. These new algorithms have been tested against different instances of predefined controllers on a one-on-one combat simulator, with underlying game mechanics similar to classic arcade games of this kind. The results have been compared with other reinforcement learning controllers, showing that WEREWoLF outperforms the other algorithms for a series of different learning conditions.},

abstract={The usage of provenance data drastically increases the potential for game data mining since it is able to record causes, effects and relationships of events and objects during a game session. However, it commonly requires modifications in the game engine in order to collect such provenance data. The modifications in the game engine may be unviable in commercial (and not open source) systems. In this paper, we propose a novel and non-intrusive approach for collecting provenance data in digital games. Our proposal collects provenance data using image processing mechanisms and pre-defined image patterns, thus avoiding accessing and modifying the source code of the game. Using our approach, we are able to generate, analyze and visualize game design features based on the gameplay flow using provenance data. Furthermore, we evaluated our proposal with a well known commercial 2D game, called "Super Mario World".},

abstract={To promote a desired behavior in serious games, the rewarding mechanism is an important part of game design that can directly affect the game experience. In single player serious games, the rewarding system is generally performed by negative reinforcement (removing barriers for positive behaviors and creating barriers for negative behaviors) or positive reinforcement (providing facilities to progress in the game for positive behavior). Although research has shown the advantages of positive reinforcement compared to negative reinforcement, this issue is not well studied for multiplayer serious games. To address this problem, we propose a new rewarding framework, which is called competitive reinforcement rewarding. In this framework, a positive behavior of a player results in difficult conditions for other players competing in the game, while a negative behavior of a player facilitates the scoring process of opponents. We have applied this concept on a attention training game based on a multiplayer adversarial car racing game. We performed a comprehensive user study to evaluate the attention level, emotions and attitudes of players in competitive reinforcement versus positive/negative reinforcement versions. Our findings suggest that the competitive reinforcement rewarding framework provides more encouragement for players to increase and maintain their attention level than positive and negative reinforcement rewarding. We also showed that this rewarding framework can affect the emotional state and the behavior of players that can consequently improve their playing experience.},

From the business perspective it is crucial to predict how many players will join the game and how many will stay in the game, important factors for the company's revenue. This work aims to identify significant data from a popular Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) - World of Warcraft - using appropriate data mining methods for deduction of players profiles. Multiple linear regression was applied to check whether a player will leave or not the game in the near future. Also, a clustering technique, i.e. K-means, was used to extract clusters of players and identify their common characteristics. The regression model showed that "Level" and "Playing Density" contribute significantly to predict whether a player will or not renew the subscription, while the clustering revealed four forms of player profile: Beginner, Intermediate I, Intermediate II and Professional.},

Most of our students are technology focused, and have to learn the process of communicating their ideas in a practical manner. They must learn the balance between being passionate about their ideas and forming a cogent argument as to why their idea matters. In short, they must learn the difference between having "the great idea" and being able to ideate over hundreds, if not thousands of ideas. Through the use of the game concept pitch as a tool for communicating their ideas, we are challenging students to express themselves in a particular way. Over the course of the semester, we explore game concept pitch processes, critique, iteration, and refinement of the student's ideas as well as presentation and communication skills. We also examine how the process of "first pitch" is applicable to wider areas of computing, engineering, and science education along with career and field skills.},

abstract={Procedural content generation (PCG) is an active area of research with the potential to significantly reduce game development costs as well as create game experiences meaningfully personalized to each player. Evolutionary methods are a promising method of generating content procedurally. In particular asynchronous evolution of AI agents in an artificial life (A-life) setting is notably similar to the online evolution of non-playable characters in a video game. In this paper, we are concerned with improving the efficiency of evolution via more effective mate selection. In the spirit of PCG, we genetically encode each agent's preference for mating partners and thereby allowing the mate-selection process to evolve. We evaluate this approach in a simple predator-prey A-life environment and demonstrate that the ability to evolve a per-agent mate-selection preference function indeed significantly increases the extinction time of the population. Additionally, an inspection of the evolved preference function parameters shows that agents evolve to favor mates who have survival traits.},

abstract={Educators and trainers face similar challenges in teaching specialized, rapidly evolving knowledge that often requires quick and cost-effective updates, working towards increased student time-on-task, and encouraging broad, active participation. The pedagogical potential for serious educational games to enhance the learning experience is recognized; however the development of games remains time consuming, expensive, and requiring substantial expertise from educators, game developers, and software engineers. New approaches are needed to effectively support instructors and trainers, typically experts in educational content, and enable them to rapidly and inexpensively deploy customized games. This short paper highlights the challenging and complex research issues in developing SEGs from a learning objective centric perspective, emphasizing the importance of closely establishing a connection between in-game activities and intended learning outcomes. It then presents initial work on a semi-automated, interactive approach that addresses the issue of developing a complex educational game design infrastructure for instructors.},

In this paper, we propose two hap tic-based serious games. In the first "T Puzzle" game, the user can "feel" the weight of objects, rotate and move the 3D puzzle pieces in the virtual world. This game can be used to improve the user's spatial abilities. In the second "Mol Docking" game, the player can feel interaction forces between molecular systems and learn the process of molecular docking in collaborative virtual environment.},

This adequateness has been implemented through the use of an adaptive system design along with clear and simple guidelines in game design for maintaining the attention of users with ADHD in the task they are performing. The final goal of each test has been maintained, so as not to interfere with the game adaption to the psychological utility. Evaluation of user experience is currently being developed.

In this paper, our scoring system creates with blockchain-based data sharing for multiplayer games. We implemented the data design on the Unity game engine using the ethereum framework. The test results show that each device can connect to the network and can display the player's update score via the leaderboard. Some ethereum variables that affect the score data transaction process include gas prices, gas limits, and the gas used. The transaction speed test results show that the faster the gas limit value, the faster the transaction validation process will make the data transaction process faster. In this study, the gas limit value 500000 is the most optimal to get player score data transactions. While the average cost incurred for each data delivery score is 0.00996434 ETH.},

abstract={The main purpose of computer game is to immerse a user in a virtual environment. The perception of immersion experience has been used to develop virtual reality applications for game-based learning, healthcare, rehabilitation, etc. In traditional games, the user immersion is performed through the sense of visuals and sounds with interactions through 2D input devices like mouse and keyboards. Haptic technology can simulate tactile and kinesthetic sensations in virtual environments. Recently developed games take advantage of the haptic effects offered by some devices such as joysticks, gamepads and haptic devices. However, the main criticism of haptic-driven game development is that the real-time interactions must allow graphical updates of 30 Hz and a much higher frequency of 1 kHz for haptic feedback. This real-time interaction and feedback are very important for development of rehabilitation applications. The main goal of our research is to enable real time simulation of force feedback for rehabilitation games. This paper presents a framework for developing the virtual whack-a-mole game for rehabilitation based on haptic display. The proposed framework introduces a collision handling method to compute feedback force and provide realistic feedback through the haptic device.},

abstract={The Human Computer Interaction community is beginning to wrestle with the challenges of effective interaction design for groups collaborating in 3 dimensional virtual worlds. Understanding of the requirements and design processes necessary to support these new technologies is still emerging. While the gaming community has developed heuristics for game design over a 25 year period, the adaptation of this knowledge for the design of virtual collaboration spaces has been limited. Following a research through design approach, we create novel integrations and applications of Human Computer Interaction research methods in an attempt to understand the collaborative work of a small group of individuals in a 3 dimensional virtual world. Specifically, the fine grained perspective provided by eye-tracking (ET), and a more coarse unit of analysis, provided by All-Views-Qualitative-Analysis (AVQA), are applied to understand non-gaming interaction in 3 dimensional virtual worlds. To formalize an integrated method, we describe three lenses for analyzing eye-tracking data in graphics intensive and animated virtual applications. Then, we combine those outcomes with a single method for integrating and analyzing the points-of-view of all subjects in a small group collaborating on a creative work task in a 3 dimensional virtual world. Through these examples, we illustrate the benefits of this type of research for 3 dimensional virtual world designers.},

This paper focuses indeed on the user-centric gesture design and progressive gestural skills (rewards) that user can acquire in order to gain an engaging experience and a massive comprehension of large urban contexts mediated by visual strategies, while enabling spatial and volumetric comparisons. Structured as a serious game, the project foresaw a user experience evaluation carried out in occasion of Digital Heritage Expo, held in Marseille in november 2013. During the event, “Imago Bononiae” was studied to understand more on the interaction's aspects that take place between system and user. The visual design features that mostly connote the main interface and that, consequently, influence the behavior of users have been studied, like visibility, reliability and memorability. The affordance of the whole system has been then observed. Results presented show that “Imago Bononiae” has proved to be suitable for the large audience given its facilitated usability and the well-structured game strategy.},

abstract={This paper describes the use of “Real Pixel Image Level Generator (RPILG)” along with a design of game control, called “enhancing play with smiling” to promote the players' emotion. Our study is conducted on Science Birds, an Angry-Birds-like game. RPILG is a procedural content generation method that generates game levels with the appearance of a pixel image of things, such as a pumpkin. We apply RPILG in Science Birds. A facial expression tool is used to recognize smiles in the player. And in our design, the black bird, a kind of shooting object in the game having the power to explode blocks, is modified such that its explosion power can be enhanced according to the degree of smiling. The idea behind this game design is to encourage smiling. An experiment is conducted with fourteen participants where two modes of gameplay “smiling for enhancing the birds” and “baseline play” are compared. An online survey using Positive and Negative Affect Schedule is used to evaluate the players' emotion after they have experienced both modes. Our experimental results provide an evidence that the former mode leads to statistically significantly higher positive affect and lower negative affect.},

abstract={The Web contains vast sources of content that could be reused to reduce the development time and effort to create games. However, most Web content is unstructured and lacks meaning for machines to be able to process and infer new knowledge. The Web of Data is a term used to describe a trend for publishing and interlinking previously disconnected datasets on the Web in order to make them more valuable and useful as a whole. In this paper, we describe an innovative approach that exploits Semantic Web technologies to automatically generate games by reusing Web content. Existing work on automatic game content generation through algorithmic means focuses primarily on a set of parameters within constrained game design spaces such as terrains or game levels, but does not harness the potential of already existing content on the Web for game generation. We instead propose a holistic and more generally-applicable game generation solution that would identify suitable Web information sources and enrich game content with semantic meta-structures.},

abstract={This paper explains when and how communication and computational lower bounds for algorithms for an optimization problem translate to lower bounds on the worst-case quality of equilibria in games derived from the problem. We give three families of lower bounds on the quality of equilibria, each motivated by a different set of problems: congestion, scheduling, and distributed welfare games, welfare-maximization in combinatorial auctions with "black-box" bidder valuations, and welfare-maximization in combinatorial auctions with succinctly described valuations. The most straightforward use of our lower bound framework is to harness an existing computational or communication lower bound to derive a lower bound on the worst-case price of anarchy (POA) in a class of games. This is a new approach to POA lower bounds, which relies on reductions in lieu of explicit constructions. More generally, the POA lower bounds implied by our framework apply to all classes of games that share the same underlying optimization problem, independent of the details of players' utility functions. For this reason, our lower bounds are particularly significant for problems of game design -- ranging from the design of simple combinatorial auctions to the computation of tolls for routing networks -- where the goal is to design a game that has only near-optimal equilibria. For example, our results imply that the simultaneous first-price auction format is optimal among all "simple combinatorial auctions" in several settings.},

With the open doors of mobile companies such as Apple and Android have provided, the barrier for entry into the game development field has significantly been lowered down. Many existing works do not understand the loophole on handling resources on the mobile device wisely, causing the program to experience lag or crash. This paper presents a novel collision detection optimization especially for shooting games where massive hit testing is required. We tackle the larger problem on collision between two groups of objects, rather than on the collision checking or intersection between two single objects. The number of objects involved may be as little as five objects or as more as hundreds of objects at one time. We will explain how to optimize the speed process while not using up too much of the memory. It is always important to ensure that it does not reach the maximum memory in the mobile device to prevent any crash in the game. In our result, it shows that our algorithm is efficient in term of having no lags or crashes.},

abstract={The shift towards digital teaching is leading to an increased need for interactive teaching methods. Game-Based Learning combines teaching content with a motivating application. The learning simulation Finanzmars uses elements from Game-Based Learning to prepare the contents of a classical lecture in the field of economics for a learning game. The simulation is aimed at students of business administration or similar courses of study. The contents can be edited and extended directly by the teaching staff using an external configuration tool. The knowledge transfer is flanked by Micro Learning, systematic introductions to increasingly complex subjects, interaction with game elements and increased motivation through in-game successes such as a premium currency. The player finds himself in an economic simulation with the goal of exploiting the resources of Mars in a profitable and optimized way. In the game, construction, upgrading and repair of buildings, the development of future technology through research, the export of resources and expansion to other celestial bodies are available. The functionalities are based on possible courses of action in the real world, whose mechanisms play a central role in the lecture on the topic of finance. By means of logging and the evaluation of in-game objectives, the teachers can track the progress of the students. Our evaluation of 12 Master's students in Business Administration shows that there is an increase in economic expertise. Furthermore, the evaluation of the associated standardized AttrakDiff questionnaire according to DIN EN ISO 9241-11 certifies that the application is action-oriented and user-friendly. The description of the environment with regard to the course of studies and the teaching concept was largely done in the publication “Finanzmars im Kosmos von Blended Learning” by Marc Ritter, Christian Roschke and Volker Tolkmitt, who received the Best Paper Award in Teaching at the CARF Lucerne Conference in 2019.

abstract={With regard to applied game design, the collaboration between game designers, engineers, neuropsychologists and medical doctors has shown that it is important to create interfaces in which the learning process is made enjoyable. Achieving this depends on understanding the limitations of the patients, the hard- and software to hand, and the complexity of therapy from the various disciplinary understandings. The balance between what is ‘fun’ and what are serious needs must not be lost, at the same time, a finely calibrated equilibrium is necessary for developing successful therapeutic tools. Virtual reality games as tools for extended therapy are likely of limited application where the immersive experience cannot be adequately achieved or assessed.},

abstract={Nowadays information technology and particularly artificial intelligence is a very vital tool in different aspects of human life. One inseparable part of human life is learning which has diverse methods. From the very first days of our life we start to learn by playing games in different ways. In recent years with growth of artificial intelligence we see widespread usage of it in game designing. On the other hand, one of the most important parts of information technology to be learned is cryptography, there is a need to find a good method of learning that. In our work we propose a model which is a game, based on lesson planning and utilizes artificial intelligence. Firstly, we explain about lesson planning then describe our game design and how artificial intelligence is used.},

abstract={Pioneered in Scandinavia in the 1970s, participatory design (PD) has been recognized as an empowering, sensitive and inclusive approach. Thus it has been applied in a wide variety of fields, from architecture to teaching to game design. One of the goals of PD is to challenge the power imbalance, with the aim of reducing the power differential between researchers and participants. This paper borrows from Foucault's ideas that power is relations of force as a theoretical guideline, to explore how power is exercised at the individual level in the case of a game design project. Recommendations are provided to help researchers overcome such issues in facilitating PD projects.},

abstract={Consistent food tracking is important for weight loss. Many people struggle with forming and maintaining the habit because it is time consuming and generally un-enjoyable. We describe the design and initial field evaluation of HappyInu, a virtual pet-care game that we developed to promote consistent food tracking. HappyInu uses daily notifications to remind users to track, provides photo-based food tracking to make the process simpler and gives virtual and cash rewards for motivation. In our pilot study, users were excited about the game-based approach and they wanted more in-game tasks and rewards to be offered. Intrinsic rewards were more motivating than cash, particularly pleasure (fun) and the need to contribute to something meaningful. However, users played HappyInu on a casual (non-daily) basis, just as they did with other smartphone games. In this paper, we discuss users' perceptions on the role of games for behavior change and the implications on game design.},

abstract={In response to the advancement of digitalization technology, the future of assembly works and associated training methods seem to evolve. Gamification, i.e. the use of game design elements in nongame contexts seem to give a potential application for training procedures in the context of assembly work. However, the study on this field is still very limited. Thus, we investigate the following topics pertaining to assembly works and gamification: (a) how is the future of industrial assembly; (b) what methods are currently used to train the assembly workers; and (c) is gamification prospective for such training. From 20 out of 53 related studies, we eventually found the most relevant literatures. The results indicate that traditional training has not met the requirements of future trends, while augmented reality training methods, may offer extra benefits than the counterparts. The concept of gamification in which operators are directly involved, appropriate with skill-based assembly work requiring hands on experience. Further cognitive considerations and physiological measurements during experiment are required to improved HCI assembly work training systems design, especially within the gamification element context.},

abstract={Gamification understood as the use of game design elements in the other contexts for the purpose of engagement has become a hot topic in years. The role of gamification in promoting learner’ learning has been investigated empirically by many scholars. To date, mixed results about the effectiveness of gamification have been reported, and researchers frequently argue that the inappropriateness of certain techniques may have contributed to these mixed findings, especially toward disaster subject. Relatively little research that stated gamification in the disaster is an effective approach to learn the subject. Moreover, disasters and emergencies have been increasing all over the world. Disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs. Today, with technological advancement, acquiring knowledge and its application is regarded as the only effective way to prevent disasters or reducing its effects. The research also aimed to review the importance of gamification integration to support the existing education and the effect of different methods of education on disaster mitigation among Indonesia community. In this regard, having the gamification to disaster educational is possible for people to acquire and increase the level of knowledge, which in return, increases the motivation and engagement of the learner. The results showed that gamification integration positively affects learner’ learning compare to existing traditional classroom method.},

abstract={Several research studies have highlighted that the traditional method of identifying dyslexia within learners is time consuming, expensive and might not be effective as some people acquired the skills to hide their disability. Particularly, no tool or method was reported in the Arab region (22 countries) that could help identify dyslexia within Arab learners. Therefore, this paper presents a developed and validated educational game to implicitly identify the level of dyslexia within learners based on their game play traces. The game was played by twenty-six children within a private school for special education with the supervision of experts from a private center for learners with disabilities. The obtained results showed that the accuracy level of identifying learners with dyslexia with the use of the game is high. Additionally, the experts reported a favorable perception and high technology acceptance degree towards the game. The findings of this research could enhance the educational technology field by providing an educational game design for implicit identification of dyslexia level.},

abstract={Among the different kinds of incident processing centers, the service desk has highlighted with the increasing number of its adopters around the world. Nonetheless, even though it has a series of desirable features and resources, a service desk needs several procedures to survive, without which it can severely suffer with inadequate or inexistent IT service management. In order to overcome this need, the framework of best IT practices, mostly known as ITIL, has been widely implemented on such scenarios. However, its adherence by service desk operators, has not always been as friendly as it should. The main reason for this can be made evident when considering how hard is to comply with so many recommendations laid out on such framework. Additionally, the technical staff attention and worry on complying with that framework is so great that incident treatment quality can be impaired. It is exactly on that challenge, where the persuasive technique named gamification arises here as a proposal to turn hard, tense or tedious tasks, that are commonly performed on this way on service desks, into more interesting and engaging activities in a daily basis. Through game design and elements, gamification can improve the service desk operators' motivation and engaging, by making them more involved in their job and consequentely optimizing the use and adherence of ITIL recommended IT best practices. In this scenario, since the more IT best practices are adequately followed and the more incident treatment quality increases, obviously the more IT service management quality would be improved.},

In this work, we take a modular Statechart-based game AI modelling approach and develop a reuse strategy to enable fast development of new AIs. This is aided through the creation of a standardized interface for Statechart modules in a layered architecture. Reuse is enabled at a high-level through functional groups that encapsulate behaviour. These concepts are solidified with the development of the SkyAI tool. SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal.},

abstract={The rationale behind domain specific modeling in software engineering is to raise the level of abstraction while boosting automation in software production. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) typically fall into two categories: high-level, script-like languages and visual modeling languages. The code generation engines that come with them are capable of translating what are written (or visually expressed) to executable code. Our goal is to build a DSL for game development that integrate script-like languages into conceptual models, which is analogous to the way the Object Constraint Language (OCL) puts more semantics in UML models (but ours is essentially at a higher level of abstract than OCL/UML). We identify the following problems for such a DSL: i) conceptual models do not adequately capture the logic of games, ii) keeping conceptual models and rules in synch, iii) defining a rule description language that is powerful enough to decoratively capture most game logic and at the same time facilitates the automation, i.e allows a DSL engine to generate executable code. In this paper, we present our DSL that addresses these three problems. We propose a high-level declarative language for capturing rules. We also report prototypes we have built for our DSL in this paper.},

Integrating serious games into curricula in these contexts could significantly benefit the students, as well as the community in general. This work, therefore, promotes technology as one of the crucial educational and pedagogical components. It provides an overview of selected educational games created for pre-school and elementary school children with specific learning intentions revolving around alphabet, colours and elementary science. A pilot study was performed with neuro-typical and neuro-atypical children, and professionals working at an NGO ``EDUS - Education for All''. The findings show that both students and instructors have a positive attitude towards the game design and logic, and more importantly, towards the technology itself. In the end, we believe that the games presented in this paper can be valuable resources for teachers, as well as for children and parents.},

abstract={Engineering instructors often rely on lectures as their primary mode of instruction even in project courses. In the lecture mode of instruction student engagement with the course material is often low or non-existent until the date of an assessment activity (assignment or exam) is near. In passive learning environments students often do not get many opportunities to develop their soft skills. Many engineering educators regard experiential learning as a better way to train the next generation of software engineers to do project work. This paper describes the authors' experiences introducing active learning opportunities in a junior level software engineering course and a senior level game design course. The materials created for these courses were developed using a variation of the ADDIE (analyze, design, development, implementation, evaluation) process model. The team created a mix of case-study review, role play, trigger videos, and hands-on exercises involving work with software engineering artifacts or tools to facilitate coverage of the topics. The investigators collected observational data on student engagement while they were involved in various class activities and found that they were least engaged when listening to even short lectures. Student feedback and the authors' own lessons learned are being used to plan the next iterations of these courses.},

Leadership is often discussed in the context of project management, and leaders referred to as being able to organize and motivate a group of people to successfully finish a given project. In order to inspire, organize and motivate others, leaders need to have advanced social skills. Successful leaders are constantly trying to improve their social skills and knowledge. Life-long learning is important for leaders, especially learning by experience and in a real-time environment. Simulation games enable participants to learn by doing which gives them the opportunity to understand real everyday situations and possible consequences better. During simulation games, users train, analyze and predict possible actions which help them in the decision making process. The goal of this paper is twofold. The first goal is to present and analyze the usage of simulation games in leadership, their desirable characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages in the area of leadership.

pages={1-9},
abstract={In developed societies road safety skills are taught early and often practiced under the supervision of a parent, providing children with a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge. At some point children will attempt to cross a road unsupervised, at that point in time their safety depends on the effectiveness of their road safety education. To date, various attempts to supplement road safety education with technology were made. Most common approach focus on addressing declarative knowledge, by delivering road safety theory in an engaging fashion. Apart from expanding on text based resources to include instructional videos and animations, some stakeholders (e.g.: Irish Road Safety Authority) attempt to take advantage of game-based learning [1]. However, despite the high capacity for interaction being common in Virtual Environments, available game-based solutions to road safety education are currently limited to delivering and assessing declarative knowledge. With recent advancements in the field of Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Displays, procedural knowledge might also be addressed in Virtual Environments. This paper describes the design and development process of a computer-supported learning system that attempts to address psycho-motor skills involved in crossing a road safely, changing learners' attitude towards road safety best practices, and enabling independent practice of transferable skills. By implementing game-based learning principles and following best practice for serious game design (such as making educational components essential to successful game-play, or instructional scaffolding) we hope to make it not only more effective, but also engaging, allowing us to rely on learners' intrinsic motivation [2], to increase their independent practice time and provide them with feedback that will help to condition safe behaviour and increase retention. Presence in Virtual Reality might evoke responses to Virtual Environment as if it was real (RAIR) [3] and enable learners to truly experience learning scenarios. In consequence leading to formation of autobiographical memories constructed from multisensory input, which should result in an increased knowledge retention and transfer [4].},

However, such games are also an important potential tool for teaching and promoting collaboration, a concept crucial to academia, industry, and education. Before we can develop the necessary design principles to guide game design or the assessment tools to determine the impact of collaborative video games, we must first understand the concept of collaboration. Unfortunately, collaboration is ambiguous, and contradictory definitions exist throughout literature. To reconcile the research space and develop a concrete understanding of collaboration, we analyzed over 25 existing studies and surveys from a wide range of disciplines and with diverse target demographics. The resulting multilevel taxonomy has four main components: group quality, coordination, communication, and support, which in turn are split into subcomponents. Our taxonomy can be used by researchers to inform study design, by game creators to develop design principles, and by educators to guide collaboration assessment.},

While some substantial progress has been made in this area, there are still several challenges ranging from content evaluation to personalized content generation. In this paper, we present a novel PCG framework based on machine learning, named learning-based procedure content generation (LBPCG), to tackle a number of challenging problems. By exploring and exploiting information gained in game development and public player test, our framework can generate robust content adaptable to end-user or target players on-line with minimal interruption to their gameplay experience. As the data-driven methodology is emphasized in our framework, we develop learning-based enabling techniques to implement the various models required in our framework. For a proof of concept, we have developed a prototype based on the classic open source first-person shooter game, Quake. Simulation results suggest that our framework is promising in generating quality content.},

abstract={Devising a system requirements specification is a challenging task. Even after several decades of system development research, specifications for large-scale, widely-used systems remain difficult. In this paper, we suggest a first step toward a requirements specification through a stakeholder involvement approach with game elements. We report preliminary findings from a practice case in which our methods are applied to the requirement specification phase of a project management system. The analysis showed that our game approach fostered innovative idea generation and captured implicit user expectations, and as a result provided a list of requirements from other perspectives than those of conventional specification analysis. The granularities of extracted system requirements need to be refined and transferred to detailed requirements for developers to use, however, our results imply that our stakeholder involvement method with game elements can be effectively utilized as a first step towards requirement specification.},

abstract={This article describes the instructional design and evaluation of a course about project management in a software engineering post-graduation program using different teaching approaches and with a focus on active learning. We use four different approaches: digital educational game, non-digital educational game, hands-on activity, and experiential activity. Each one of the activities is evaluated for the aspects of motivation, user experience, and learning, following the MEEGA evaluation model and Cidral's experiential activity model. To verify the perceptions of students over time, we also assess graduated students that have concluded this course after two to four years, considering the aspects of motivation and learning. Results indicate a high level of approval for dynamic activities, regarding both motivation and learning. Activities with greater impact on motivation and learning are dynamics and educational games, group practical activities, and group theoretical activities. Among the factors that most influence students' motivation, we highlight: active learning, teacher knowledge, the taste of the area, and teaching methods. We realized that there was no significant variation in the perception of the activities by students over time.},

abstract={Computational analysis of player style has significant potential for video game design: it can provide insights into player behavior, as well as the means to dynamically adapt a game to each individual's style of play. To realize this potential, computational methods need to go beyond considerations of challenge and ability and account for aesthetic aspects of player style. We describe here a semiautomatic unsupervised learning approach to modeling player style using multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We argue that this approach is widely applicable for modeling player style in a wide range of games, including commercial applications, and illustrate it with two case studies: the first for a novel arcade game called Snakeotron, and the second for Rogue Trooper, a modern commercial third-person shooter video game.},

abstract={Teaching and learning processes of certain subjects are mainly teacher-centred. This approach leads to decrease attention and interest among students due to having no interaction. Game is a relatively new tool to serve educational purposes. However, there is little research dedicated to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) developed for educational purposes. This research provides a conceptual framework for MMORPGs in education and empowers students to be more engaged in the learning processes. Therefore, a survey analysis is conducted to determine students' perception about effectiveness of MMORPGs and the required features of a game development tool. It also helped to establish learning possibilities and solutions that can be incorporated into a university program from these tools in order to invigorate creative talents of students. It is expected that the findings of survey analysis can help to create more dynamic interactions between students and lecturers, and improve content instruction via MMORPGs. Both lecturers and students teach and learn in a new way, forming a more creative environment to allow a more productive communication between students and lecturers.},

abstract={Edutainment has emerged as a computational area that combines entertainment and education in order to engage students to learn in creative ways. Role Playing Games (RPG) are a type of games where players take the role of a character within a story and make decisions to advance and reach a given goal. RPG's are highly interactive entertainment tools that propose complex virtual worlds and rich and interesting story lines. These characteristics could be used to engage students and as vehicles to deliver educational material. Based on this, we have developed a generic architecture for edutainment systems called RchEd. This architecture defines a User Interface component to support multimedia deployment. An Edutainment System component will manage user interactions and the game development.

abstract={Students with a technology focus often express and demonstrate that they find it difficult to communicate their ideas and designs. Students in the Rochester Institute of Technology's School of Interactive Games and Media are further challenged in that in order to be successful in their pursuit of a career in game design and development, they need to effectively convey their game ideas and design specifications while expressing the passion for the ideas that will convince others to climb on board and work on their projects. In this paper, we discuss the way we help our students develop these skills within a course structure. Through several course offerings, the faculty and students anecdotally noted that the students communication skills improved and their comfort in communication improved as well. In order to more accurately determine if this observed improvement was measurable, a survey of comfort with communication skills was created. The paper will present the results of an exploratory study using the instrument, which involved administering the survey to the students in the course as well as students in another course without a focus in development of these skills. The results from both sets of students were analyzed to determine if there was an increase in comfort with communication skills and to begin a process of validating this new instrument.},

abstract={Procedural generation of virtual worlds is an important aspect of game development since decades, typically for increasing replayability or for speeding up the level creation process. However, the utilization of this potential has always been a great challenge due to the difficult controllability of the underlying algorithms or limitations to specific level geometries, like 2D regular structures. In this paper, we present a novel approach for semi-automatic generation of a wide variety of 2D/3D corridor and room systems. The underlying processing pipeline is based on a separation between a user-guided generation of a graph-based abstract level structure and a fully-automatic construction of the corresponding geometry using a pre-modeled component library. The core algorithm is built on the computation of an extended minimal spanning tree, which can be controlled by a set of intuitive vertex and edge parameters. First experimental results have shown that our incremental generation pipeline allows the efficient creation of complex indoor levels, minimizing limitations on level and game designers' creativity.},

pages={1-8},
abstract={This paper describes the development of a computer-based serious game to enable older individuals to practice Tai Chi at home on their own. The player plays the game by imitating Tai Chi movements presented by a virtual instructor on the screen. The proposed system is decomposed into two modules. The first module is the game design, i.e., the process of recording an instructor training Tai Chi. Acquired data are used to create gesture templates and a virtual instructor. The second module is the game play in which the player attempts to mimic the virtual instructor. Gestures are measured in real-time and then compared with the prerecorded Tai Chi gesture template corresponding to the displayed movement. Visual feedback indicates how well the player imitated the instructor. The proposed system is not designed to classify gestures but to evaluate the similarity of a given gesture with a gesture template. The Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) method is applied to compute such similarity. The proposed approach (1) facilitates the design of assessment tools in which the user has to follow a sequence of predefined movements and (2) applicable to other domains, such as telerehabilitation.},

abstract={Reliving the medieval past is an important economic factor in Europe, physically as well as digitally. The broad public interest in the Middle Ages is still continuing, including all aspects of medieval life and culture, in media and as events on historical sites. Also the gaming community has a strong affinity towards medieval contents which is clearly visible in numerous popular titles and an ever-growing market. There is probably a substantial overlap between those two communities. Our approach envisions a serious game for both communities, to provide education on historical construction techniques and foster motivation for preservation of built heritage. Thereby we put a focus on the conceptual game design based on historical research and a reference to a heritage site. The implementation was done as a proof of concept. The idea has been realized with the listed heritage castle Waldenfels in Upper Austria. The context of the game is set by the medieval building phase of the castle which is only partially preserved. Its content focuses on medieval professions in construction, including their tools, materials and methods. The game's target audience are local people, tourists with an interest in castles, architecture students, as well as craftsmen and conservators. The benefit of using contemporary communication strategies like serious games for traditional construction techniques lies in the vitalisation of intangible heritage for an interested audience. Thus, the game aims to motivate and educate its audience to participate in preserving local tangible heritage as a community effort. We see our approach as a contribution to a sustainable living heritage that is supported by an involved community.},

In this paper, we tackle the boredom aspect of the rehabilitation process wherein we develop a therapy system that uses computer games to emulate the therapeutic activities. We describe, in some details, the issues involved in the development process. Commercial of the shelf product is employed (the Xbox Kinect) so the cost is significantly reduced and the accessibility is greatly increased. The system was tested on children at a local hospital, and the feedback was highly encouraging.

abstract={Scripted Collaborative Learning (CL) promotes meaningful interactions among students. Unfortunately, in some situations, the use of scripts causes motivational problems which in turn may lead to negative learning outcomes. In the last years, gamification has emerged as a promising technique to motivate and engage students towards learning process. However, gamification requires personalization based on knowledge about game design, and their impact on the students' motivation and learning outcomes. To address these issues, we proposed the formalization of an ontology to support the gamification of CL scenarios in which the game elements are tailored for each situation. These CL scenarios are known as ont-gamified CL sessions, and this paper presents the results of one empirical study conducted to evaluate their effects on the participants' intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes. This study was carried out as quasi-experiment with 62 undergraduate Brazilian students who participated either in non-gamified or ont-gamified CL sessions. Findings indicate that the intrinsic motivation was better in ont-gamified CL sessions, and that there was no significant difference on learning outcomes. Based on these results, we concluded that our approach is likely to deal with motivational problems in scripted CL.},

abstract={The growth of online game development now a day makes us have to be more careful in doing trade or transactions inside the game. A transactions in the virtual world today is filled with virtual crime which known as cyber crime. Common cyber crime in online games is fraud related to virtual goods or usually referred to the item mall [4]. In this study, the authors tried to suggest a method for prevention of fraud within transactions in the online game by tracing the phone number which been use from the form registration for online gaming. Analysis of this case is done by using the rules of the applicable rules in Indonesia is the ITE Law No. 11 of 2008 and Article 378 of the Criminal Code.},

abstract={In this paper, game design for demand response in smart grid from a control perspective is investigated. A pricing scheme is proposed to ensure the efficiency of the Nash equilibrium. The designed game is proven to be a state-based potential game and the stationary state Nash equilibrium is the social optimal solution. An adaptive penalty based pricing mechanism is proposed and adaptive control laws are designed for both the game states and strategies. The convergence of the stationary state Nash equilibrium is guaranteed under the proposed control laws. We also consider a special case with stubborn players in the game and show that the strategies of the rational players converge to the best response strategies. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract={As the paradigm of crowdsensing involves the data collection from users, the issue of designing reward to incentivize the users is fundamentally important to be addressed, thereby effectively enhancing the participation. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in crowdsensing-based healthcare services, the accuracy of diet recommendation for a certain user can be promoted by exploiting the nutritional information contributed and shared by the socially-connected friends of him/her taking similar types of food. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive schemes in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users. Understanding the behaviors of users and service providers in socially-aware crowdsensing is of paramount importance for incentive schemes. Considering this, we propose a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game approach to model the strategic interactions among service providers and users, where the social influence of users and the strategic interconnections of service providers are jointly and formally integrated into the game modeling. Through backward induction methods, we theoretically validate the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Simulations are conducted to evaluate game equilibrium properties, and the results are presented to assess and demonstrate the performance effectiveness of the proposed game model.},

abstract={This paper describes a method for generative player modeling and its application to the automatic testing of game content using archetypal player models called procedural personas. Theoretically grounded in psychological decision theory, procedural personas are implemented using a variation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) where the node selection criteria are developed using evolutionary computation, replacing the standard UCB1 criterion of MCTS. Using these personas, we demonstrate how generative player models can be applied to a varied corpus of game levels and demonstrate how different playstyles can be enacted in each level. In short, we use artificially intelligent personas to construct synthetic playtesters. The proposed approach could be used as a tool for automatic play testing when human feedback is not readily available or when quick visualization of potential interactions is necessary. Possible applications include interactive tools during game development or procedural content generation systems where many evaluations must be conducted within a short time span.},

abstract={Procedural content generation (PCG) is a method of content creation fully or semi-performed by computers. PCG is widely used in game development to generate game content, from Rogue (1998) to No Man's Sky (2016). PCG generates final contents, which are ready to be added to a game, or intermediate contents, which are might work as content sketch to be polished by human designers. In this paper we survey the current state of procedural dungeon generation (PDG) research, a subarea of PCG. We analyzed the works according to the game features they generate, the solution strategy employed and the taxonomy of procedural content generation. Some of the relevant findings of the survey are: (1) PDG for 3D levels has been little explored; (2) few works supported levels with barriers, a game mechanic which blocks, temporarily, the player progression, and; (3) and just a few solutions relied on mixed-initiative approach, where a human design content is combined with a computer generated level.},

However, some problems in second language learning have not been well solved. Vocabulary is a key part of second language acquisition. At present, many learners are motivated by external factors to learn. Therefore, second language learners still have serious anxiety. This study helped learners improve their learning experience by integrating embodied interactive games into second language vocabulary learning. Learners used body behavior and voice interaction to learn vocabulary in games, which can help reduce learners' anxiety and boredom. This study compared the vocabulary learning of embodied interactive game with the vocabulary learning based on cards. The results showed that the learners' anxiety was significantly reduced by using embodied interactive games. However, this kind of learning method also causes the decrease of learning performance. We discussed and analyzed the causes of this situation through further interviews with participants and analysis of game design.},

In this preliminary study, concept maps were selected as scaffolding tools to help students navigate through the MR learning space, and an educational game prototype named MMRCM integrating MR and concept maps was developed to investigate students’ technology acceptance about it. Considering the novelty of this new type of MR application, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed with the MR game design elements and the concept map usefulness as external factors. A middle school physics experiment using MMRCM was conducted to help students learn the abstract concepts of friction. The evaluation results showed that the model’s external factors have significant correlations with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings indicated explicit intention to use MMRCM, which implied that MR gaming and concept maps could be integrated as an effective instructional tool in science education.},

abstract={Virtual environments can be valid and efficient tools for neuropsychological rehabilitation of cognitive impairments. However,the specification of the virtual task is not easy for neuropsychologists who are not aware of game design and implementation issues. We present the method that we have followed to help therapists to describe the expected task functioning. Our system is split into different subsystems: interactions, task logic, messages,scoring and feedback. This way, therapists specify the requirements of each subsystem separately, which comes out to be easier and clearer. The game structure manages and composes the input and output of the different subsystems to run the game. All the interactions are specified according to a common syntax. This provides the desired flexibility to add, remove and modify interactions in run-time. In order to control the location of all the objects of the scenario, for each receiver surface, we define a pick-and-place grid that keeps record of the objects piled onto it. The game logic is implemented as a non-deterministic automaton that controls each task state, modifies in run-time the different subsystems and programs new interactions.Moreover, we have designed a graphical editor to describe the game logic in a simple way, focusing only on relevant states of the application.},

abstract={Voltage control and reactive power management are two critically important criteria for ensuring quality power delivery and system stability in the grid. As the two issues are coupled, they have been generally tackled simultaneously. In this paper, we utilize the concept of stochastic game modeling from game theory to develop a novel algorithm to solve the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem of reactive power reserve maximization and voltage profile improvement. The MOO is first reduced to a single objective optimization (SOO) problem using the weighted-sum (or scalarization method). The solution to the SOO problem is then viewed as the equilibrium solution of a stochastic game. The algorithm that implements our proposed solution concept is validated in MATLAB/MATPOWER using the IEEE-39 (New England) bus system model, and very encouraging results are reported.},

abstract={This paper examines if photogrammetry can be performed in virtual environments. For the first approach a 3D scene (an object) is being rendered with a virtual camera in the way photography for photogrammetry is performed in the reality. For the second approach, a real-time 3D rendering engine i.e. an online 3D game has been selected. Screenshots are being collected while changing the camera position inside the game environment, again same as photography for photogrammetry. In both methods, the aim is to examine if photogrammetry can be achieved using non-physical cameras and virtual objects. Collected screenshots or rendered images are used to regenerate the 3D scene or object. This may raise the question of “what is the point of re-virtualizing a virtual object/scene?” A quick answer for now is educational purposes where a tutor (real or virtual character) can walk beside the learner (real character) inside an online virtual environment and teach photogrammetry without using physical elements. However, the main notion of virtual photogrammetry and consequently write up of this paper is explained. The topic itself is self-explanatory. The paper will discuss the step by step virtual photogrammetry by illustrating the results obtained through the course of study. To our knowledge this approach has not been practiced yet, at least not published. Moving towards the future, it is important to consider noticeable changes that are happening in education style. Photogrammetry is one important area in many industries e.g. game development, 3D printing, archeology, etc. Making the learning process faster and easier is one of the outcomes of this study. Several third party software have been used in this study. The aim is not to develop a virtual photogrammetry package, but to demonstrate the feasibility of developing one, in the future.},

abstract={Although professional writing research has explored the key role of written communication shaping the American professions, this research focuses almost exclusively on the engineering profession and its workplaces. Inversely, no research investigates professional writing in art and design workplaces such as game development corporations; graphics design firms or radio stations. Furthermore, because the genres of professional writing are tied to specific professional contexts, our knowledge of engineers' writing practices does not automatically transfer to the writing that art and design professionals do. If the National Endowment of the Arts' recent report predicting job growth in the arts relative to other professions is accurate, professional writing research must immediately address the gap in our knowledge of writing in the arts in order to portray a complete and current picture of professional writing in North America [3]. This paper reports on a scholarly and pedagogical work-in-progress designed to solve the two interrelated problems: the research gap in empirical knowledge of creative professionals' writing practices, and the corresponding lack of textbooks and handbooks on this topic.},

abstract={Computer games are widely used to improve student motivation and engagement in Computer Science courses. The process of design and implementation of a playable game, however, is a challenging task and is best accomplished in upper-level courses. Mobile games, on the other hand, are simpler and, thus, easier to program for students in lower-level courses. By exposing these students to a breadth of advanced topics in computing, we can also demonstrate that CS reaches far beyond coding. This paper describes our evaluation of several learning modules designed for introductory CS courses that use mobile game development as a learning context aimed to boost student motivation and engagement with the course material.},

abstract={This innovative practice work-in-progress study presents the technical architecture and pedagogical design from a new type of laboratory environment intended to resolve an experiential disconnect between students and educators or instructional designers. The cybersecurity laboratory exercise is a common feature in computing education. Researchers and instructional designers suggest these laboratory exercises are constructivist by nature and impart an active learning experience. However, students report an overtly objectivist perspective when asked about how they use the same laboratories. More specifically, whereas traditional laboratory exercise designs are theme parks in game design terms, the Cyber Engineering Learning Facility (CELF) is designed and implemented as a sandbox. To that end, the CELF uses the pedagogical concept of a phenomenarium and first principles of cyber science to engender a full stack Bloom's taxonomy experience. Preliminary results suggest the CELF design and implementation is operating as intended but with room for additional innovation. To that effect, we present analysis of the infrastructure utilization as well as analysis of student perceptions. Further, we discuss limitations of the current CELF design along with several avenues for future innovation.},

abstract={Automatic generation of game content is an important challenge in computer game design. Such generation requires methods that are both efficient and guaranteed to produce playable content. While existing methods are adequate for currently available types of games, games based on more complex entities and structures may require new methods. In this paper, we use computational complexity analysis to explore algorithmic options for efficiently evaluating the playability of and generating playable groups of enhanced agents that are capable of exchanging items and facts with each other and human players. Our results show that neither of these problems can be solved both efficiently and correctly either in general or relative to a surprisingly large number of restrictions on enhanced agent structure and gameplay. We also give the first restrictions under which the playability evaluation problem is solvable both efficiently and correctly.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the findings of an interview study that was conducted in 2009, which collected data on three major game industry conferences. The study indicates a rise of instrumentalist views within the game industry parallel to personal, more artistic views. Processes are seen more and more as a matter of control rather than as “creative chaos.” This view is not universally shared, however, as some see great potential in tools and methods for innovation, while others still look at game development as a rather organic and uncontrollable process. The views towards innovation show also other differences. In this paper we describe seven different attitude profiles that reflect the different categories of interviewee attitudes toward innovation in the game industry. Those profiles are artists, universalists, followers, evangelists, nihilists, instrumentalists, and scarecrows.},

abstract={Computer enhanced board and card games constitute a highly engaging and entertaining activity as attested by their widespread popularity and the large amount of dedicated players. Nonetheless, when considering these digital counterparts of traditional board games it becomes evident that certain features of the latter, such as the flexibility of games and the inherent social interactions that regard the player as an active participant and not merely as the end-user of a product, have been in general neglected. In particular, the ability to customize and adapt games according to the players' needs is one of the key factors of their success and should thus not be ignored when porting them to the digital environment. In this paper we present our work on a holistic framework titled FlexibleRules that addresses these limitations by bringing the intrinsic flexibility of board games played in the traditional environment into the digital one, while additionally aiming to increase the level of involvement of end-users, the players, with basic programing skills, in the game development process. A multi-faceted user evaluation study validates the effectiveness of our approach and provides encouraging results for further research.},

abstract={Machine learning games such as NERO incorporate adaptive methods such as neuroevolution as an integral part of the gameplay by allowing the player to train teams of autonomous agents for effective behavior in challenging open-ended tasks. However, rigorously evaluating such human-guided machine learning methods and the resulting teams of agent policies can be challenging and is thus rarely done. This paper presents the results and analysis of a large scale online tournament between participants who evolved team agent behaviors and submitted them to be compared with others. An analysis of the teams submitted for the tournament indicates a complex, non-transitive fitness landscape, multiple successful strategies and training approaches, and performance above hand-constructed and random baselines. The tournament and analysis presented provide a practical way to study and improve human-guided machine learning methods and the resulting NPC team behaviors, potentially leading to better games and better game design tools in the future.},

Elegance is related to a game's simplicity, clarity, and efficiency, while shibui is a more complex concept from Japanese aesthetics that also incorporates depth. These provide new metrics for quantifying and categorizing games that are largely independent of existing measurements such as tractability and quality. Relevant ideas from Western and Eastern aesthetics are introduced, the meaning of elegance and shibui in combinatorial games is examined, and methods for estimating these values empirically are derived from complexity analyses. Elegance and shibui scores are calculated for a number of example games, for comparison. Preliminary results indicate shibui estimates to be more reliable than elegance estimates.},

abstract={Modeling of 3D objects and scenes have become a common tool in different applied fields from simulation-based design in high-end engineering applications (aviation, civil structures, engine components, etc.) to entertainment (computer-based animation, video-game development, etc.). In Biology and related fields, 3D object modeling and reconstruction provide valuable tools to support the visualization, comparison and even morphometric analysis in both academical and applied tasks. Such computational tools, usually implemented as web-based virtual reality applications, significantly reduce the manipulation of fragile samples, preventing their damage and, even, their complete loss. On the other hand, they allow to take the morphological properties of physical specimens to the digital domain, giving support to common entomology tasks such as characterization, morphological taxonomy and teaching. This paper addresses the problem of producing reliable 3D point clouds from the surface of entomological specimens, based on a proved approach for multi view 3D reconstruction from high resolution pictures. Given the traditional issues of macro-photography for small sized objects (i.e. short depth of field, presence of subtle and complex structures, etc.), a pre-processing protocol, based on focus stacking, supported the generation of enhanced views obtained by an acquisition device specifically designed for this work. The proposed approach has been tested on a sample of six representative subjects from the Entomological Collection of the Centro de Biosistemas, Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano (Colombia). The resulting point clouds exhibit an overall good visual quality for the body structure the selected specimens, while file sizes are portable enough to support web based visualization.},

abstract={In game development, Procedural Content Generation is an approach that replaces the designer's task in creating contents of games, e.g., game maps. We introduce an incremental learning process that utilizes Inductive Learning (IL) of Answer Set Programs (ASP) to automate solving maps generation problems rather than to explicitly specify the characteristics of the maps. In an incremental learning process, a complex learning task is divided into a sequence of learning iterations, where each iteration consists of a set of smaller learning tasks to learn a set of rules. In order to speed up the learning process, each task in the same iteration is solved asynchronously. Our experiments show that IL of ASP successfully learns an answer set program. That is, it provides a set of rules for generating a collection of game maps that possess the same characteristics as the maps referred in the learning scenario.},

abstract={Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.},

In this article, we study the problem of training intelligent agents in service of game development. Unlike the agents built to “beat the game,” our agents aim to produce human-like behavior to help with game evaluation and balancing. We discuss two fundamental metrics based on which we measure the human-likeness of agents, namely skill and style, which are multifaceted concepts with practical implications outlined in this article. We report four case studies in which the style and skill requirements inform the choice of algorithms and metrics used to train agents; ranging from A* search to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL). Furthermore, we, show that the learning potential of state-of-the-art deep RL models does not seamlessly transfer from the benchmark environments to target ones without heavily tuning their hyperparameters, leading to linear scaling of the engineering efforts, and computational cost with the number of target domains.},

With introducing a powerfully amazing mathematical transformation, the complex non-cooperative Matrix Power Control Game (MPCG) is absolutely simplified, which is easily solved by the simplex method.

That is, the algorithm learns online in real-time the solution to the game design HJI equation. This method finds in real-time suitable approximations of the optimal value, and the saddle point control policy and disturbance policy, while also guaranteeing closed-loop stability. The adaptive algorithm is implemented as an actor/critic structure which involves simultaneous continuous-time adaptation of critic, control actor, and disturbance neural networks. We call this online gaming algorithm `synchronous' zero-sum game policy iteration. A persistence of excitation condition is shown to guarantee convergence of the critic to the actual optimal value function. Novel tuning algorithms are given for critic, actor and disturbance networks. The convergence to the optimal saddle point solution is proven, and stability of the system is also guaranteed. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the new algorithm.},

We use the classic game Blackjack as a testbed, and compare condition induction with the RIPPER algorithm, exhaustive-greedy search in statement space, genetic programming and axis-aligned search.

abstract={In Virtual Reality (VR), virtual environments, and gaming, audio greatly impacts the user, yet it is an area that has been under researched quite recently. While music and environmental sounds have been used to great effect throughout gaming history to craft a more immersive experience, spatial audio doesn't see as much focus. Not only does well made spatial audio allow a user to become more immersed in their virtual experience, it is an important channel for information about their environment. With the advent of VR, games are putting more work into spatial audio and audio design, and now the results are becoming available for both research and game development. This paper will look at not only why spatial audio can greatly improve virtual experiences, but also some of the new technologies that have become available in recent times which make the implementation of spatial audio far easier and of a higher quality than ever before. It will also look at some planned research to examine the advantages of spatial audio in sonified virtual environments using Unity 3D.},

abstract={[Context] The inclusion of programming concepts in high school education has been emerging, since applying computing in high school education is a way to motivate and prepare students into the field of technology. [Objective] This work evaluates the teaching programming games for high school students based on different forms of distance education (online video lessons, broadcasted live or recorded, and tutorials in PDF). [Method] A case study was performed in the second half of 2014 with 30 high school students enrolled in an online game programming challenge. The students had access to the different formats of online lessons and they were monitored by tutors in a online learning environment. [Results] Over 75% of the students performed and sent all the activities requested in the study, suggesting that all investigated online formats are effective. However, 85% of students indicated their preference to use recorded video classes to learn programming. Finally, 100% of the students said that they would participate again in such challenge, showing the attractiveness of the game development. [Conclusions] We considered that online formats (specially recorded video) can be used to promote the development of games to introduce programming knowledge in high school education. However, the lessons learned (difficults found and improvement suggestions) should be taken in consideration to implement online solutions in large scale.},

abstract={MOOCs actually share many similarities with MMOPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games). Since the latter is more successful in appealing participants, it will be beneficial to reflect which ideas from game design are effective to lengthen the engagement of MOOCs students. In this paper, feasible implications from gamification monographs were listed into a questionnaire to analyze students' preferences on MOOCs instructional environment. Three environment factors are extracted: content preparation, interaction and assessment. A structural equation model was proposed to illustrate the relationships between these factors. After verified, the implications work as criteria for volunteers to rate the environment quality of 76 Chinese MOOCs in six different platforms. It turned out that the scores on three factors can be used to predict the engagement endurance level of MOOCs by using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Its error rate is 18.92%. Moreover, correlation analysis found that content preparation (r=0.57, p=<;0.001) is the most effective factor that affects the engagement.},

abstract={The graphical quality of modern videogames are the result of a steep evolution of hardware over the last two decades, but the game controls that are part of mainstream gaming did not change much in the same time period. To change this, biofeedback techniques using physiological sensors are being studied as possible replacements for traditional videogame interaction devices. In this paper, we continue on-going research by introducing unimodal and, for the first time, multimodal biofeedback game mechanics aiming at enhanced depth and expanded game design possibilities. We developed a First-Person Shooter to test these concepts against traditional unimodal mechanisms, and conducted an empirical study with 32 players. Both unimodal and multimodal variants provided high levels of fun to players, with subtle differences suggesting that these types are best leveraged depending on the interaction context on which they are applied.},

abstract={Predicting and classifying student's performance using data mining techniques have been gaining an enormous amount of attention from researchers and practitioners. However, the use of games for the classification of student's ability level is still slightly. This study focuses on identification of important factors for determining student level performance on Math. The best classification algorithm is observed as part of intelligent game development research for assessment of children with special needs. The real dataset from randomly selected of elementary school is taken to construct a dataset. About 135 normal students and 25 children with special needs played the game and did a manual test. Our study shows that the age, gender, grade, and mark of each level became important factors in determining the level of math skill for the normal student. However age, gender, and grade don't have a correlation with math level of children with special needs. Six classification methods, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), SMO, Decision Table, JRip, and J48, were performed to predict math skill performance level of normal students and children with special needs. JRip with 10 fold cross validation gives the highest percentage of accuracy of 64.12.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={1-7},
abstract={In this paper, a novel approach for human gesture classification on skeletal data is proposed for the application of exergaming in physiotherapy. Unlike existing methods, we propose to use a general classifier like Random Forests to recognize dynamic gestures. The temporal dimension is handled afterwards by majority voting in a sliding window over the consecutive predictions of the classifier. The gestures can have partially similar postures, such that the classifier will decide on the dissimilar postures. This brute-force classification strategy is permitted, because dynamic human gestures show sufficient dissimilar postures. Online continuous human gesture recognition can classify dynamic gestures in an early stage, which is a crucial advantage when controlling a game by automatic gesture recognition. Also, ground truth can be easily obtained, since all postures in a gesture get the same label, without any discretization into consecutive postures. This way, new gestures can be easily added, which is advantageous in adaptive game development. We evaluate our strategy by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a self-captured stealth game gesture dataset and the publicly available Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 Kinect (MSRC-12) dataset. On the first dataset we achieve an excellent accuracy rate of 96.72%. Furthermore, we show that Random Forests perform better than Support Vector Machines. On the second dataset we achieve an accuracy rate of 98.37%, which is on average 3.57% better then existing methods.},

abstract={In the area of geographic information system, there are always two methods to get 3D virtual reality, one is to use a 2D professional platform such as ArcGIS software to get the virtual reality by secondary development, the other is to use a 3D or 2.5D software as a platform for development, such as the Skyline software. In this paper, we will use a different platform, Unity3D, which is usually treated as game development software, as a virtual reality development platform. Firstly, the hierarchical approach of geographic information system is adopted in the study area, and the area is divided into four layers: Terrain Layer, Building Layer, Transport Layer, Vegetation Layer, additionally, the raw data of Terrain Layer is obtained by GPS measurements. Secondly, all the geographical entities which related to different layers are converted to 3D model by AutoCAD and 3dsMax software. Thirdly, the 3D models are imported into the Unity3D, and programming with Javascript language in Visual Programming Language Editor in order to achieve Gameobjects and Scenes. Lastly, the Scenes are integrated and published on the network. The attribute data of study area is stored by MySQL which is connected with Unity game platform by external interface. Visitors can download the ActiveX control to browse the study area, the scene is keep on updating 60 times per second, the viewer will subconsciously input and immediately immersed in the virtual scene for spontaneous exploration and observation. With a full range of personalized mode of operation, the users can choose their own way to browse and participate in the virtual reality, and give full play to their imagination according to their own wishes without affecting the others by using the designated keys on the keyboard.},

abstract={Virtual Reality (VR) is morphing into a ubiquitous technology by leveraging of smartphones and screenless cases in order to provide highly immersive experiences at a low price point. The result of this shift in paradigm is now known as mobile VR (mVR). Although mVR offers numerous advantages over conventional immersive VR methods, one of the biggest limitations is related with the interaction pathways available for the mVR experiences. Using physiological computing principles, we created the PhysioVR framework, an Open-Source software tool developed to facilitate the integration of physiological signals measured through wearable devices in mVR applications. PhysioVR includes heart rate (HR) signals from Android wearables, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from a low-cost brain computer interface and electromyography (EMG) signals from a wireless armband. The physiological sensors are connected with a smartphone via Bluetooth and the PhysioVR facilitates the streaming of the data using UDP communication protocol, thus allowing a multicast transmission for a third party application such as the Unity3D game engine. Furthermore, the framework provides a bidirectional communication with the VR content allowing an external event triggering using a real-time control as well as data recording options. We developed a demo game project called EmoCat Rescue which encourage players to modulate HR levels in order to successfully complete the in-game mission. EmoCat Rescue is included in the PhysioVR project which can be freely downloaded. This framework simplifies the acquisition, streaming and recording of multiple physiological signals and parameters from wearable consumer devices providing a single and efficient interface to create novel physiologically-responsive mVR applications.},

We investigated the social nature of people talking about reading and the process of recommending books. We interviewed a gender-balanced group of participants to obtain more information about their reading habits for leisure, work, or academia.

abstract={One in three older adults in the UK over the age of sixty experience a fall. Exergaming (exercise-gaming) interventions are an alternate method of training postural control (PC) to prevent future falls, yet the movements trained in exergaming interventions are not fully understood with respect to established theory, the Systems Framework for Postural Control (SFPC). We systematically reviewed articles from six databases using search terms pertaining to older adults, PC, exergaming and falls. Full-text articles were screened for outcome measures, movement characteristics and were rated in conjunction with the SFPC. We assessed quality using the PEDro scale. Eighteen trials were included in the review with a mean PEDro score of 5.6 (1.5). A third of publications reported movement characteristics where commercial apparatus were used. Overall, 4.99 (1.27) of 9 possible areas of PC are currently trained with some not practical to train in an exergaming environment (sensory integration, reactive PC). Other areas of the SFPC are lacking due to restrictions in console apparatus and in game design due to a lack of movement ranges necessary to drive gameplay. Future game designs should consider the individual components of the SFPC and within each element the range of movement and speed of movement capabilities of an older adult. Designing for the needs of older adults and considering this framework may help train balance deficits within this population.},

The quality of such content impacts the project costs and budget. One of the biggest challenges concerning the content is how to improve its details and at the same time lower the creation costs. In this context procedural content generation techniques can help to reduce the costs associated with content creation. This paper presents a survey of classical and modern techniques focused on procedural content generation suitable for game development. They can be used to produce terrains, coastlines, rivers, roads and cities. All techniques are classified as assisted (require human intervention/guidance in order to produce results) or non-assisted (require few or no human intervention/guidance to produce the desired results).},

abstract={Many crucial applications in the fields of filmmaking, game design, education, and cultural preservation - among others - involve the modeling, authoring, or editing of 3D objects and scenes. The two major methods of creating 3D models are 1) modeling, using computer software, and 2) reconstruction, generally using high-quality 3D scanners. Scanners of sufficient quality to support the latter method remain unaffordable to the general public. Since the emergence of consumer-grade RGBD cameras, there has been a growing interest in 3D reconstruction systems using depth cameras. However, most such systems are not user-friendly, and require intense efforts and practice if good reconstruction results are to be obtained. In this paper, we propose to increase the accessibility of depth-camera-based 3D reconstruction by assisting its users with augmented reality (AR) technology. Specifically, the proposed approach will allow users to rotate/move a target object freely with their hands and see the object being overlapped with its reconstructing model during the reconstruction process. As well as being more instinctual than conventional reconstruction systems, our proposed system will provide useful hints on complete 3D reconstruction of an object, including the best capturing range; reminder of moving and rotating the object at a steady speed; and which model regions are complex enough to require zooming-in. We evaluated our system via a user study that compared its performance against those of three other stateof- the-art approaches, and found our system outperforms the other approaches. Specifically, the participants rated it highest in usability, understandability, and model satisfaction.},

abstract={New intelligent era calls for new learners and thus urgently needs a series of artificial intelligence. As a good educational platform for teaching artificial intelligence, smart cars have aroused concern and practices of all parties. However, at present, most courses and training pay more attention to basic knowledge and technology of smart cars, seldom to training based on artificial intelligence curriculum system and comprehensive competency integrating science, technology, art and management. Therefore, based on concept of iSTREAM (intelligence for Science, Technology, Robotics, Engineering, Art, and Management) and Raspberry intelligent vehicle teaching platform, this paper introduced a smart car-themed artificial intelligence courses including basic courses, specialized courses, specialized technical courses and elective courses. This course can guide learners to develop smart cars based on visual cognition, in-depth learning, VR and 3D printing integrated artistic creativity. It combines disciplines such as science, technology, art, games and management to upgrade a single knowledge and technology course into a comprehensive competency course that integrates knowledge, skills, emotion and management. Practice in Beijing NO.13 and NO.101 High School shows that this course allows students to experience scientific research process, learn artificial intelligence related knowledge and skills, understand scientific way of thinking and scientific research methods, stimulate learners' responsibility and scientific passion, and cultivate leadership skills through self-learning and partly project management.},

abstract={Visualizing and simulating the real world by means of three-dimensional (3D) models is important in many fields, especially in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM). Exploiting the human senses, such as the sense of sight with head-mounted displays (HMDs) and the sense of touch with haptic devices, has helped in creating immersive virtual-reality (VR) experiences. However, HMDs and haptics have seldom been combined, and recently the technology has been advancing rapidly in both areas. The objective of this research was to develop a VR system which combines both a consumer-level HMD and a mid-level haptic device using a game-development platform. A proof-of-concept system was developed using the Oculus Rift HMD and the Phantom Premium 1.5 High Force haptic device. The system was implemented using the Unity 3D game engine and was tested with two 3D human anatomical models, a heart and part of a skull. The technical performance of the system was evaluated, and a small preliminary user evaluation was performed. Particular challenges and limitations of currently available hardware and software are also discussed.},

It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students' engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.},

In computer programming, mathematical algorithms are used to summarize the problems, simplify the relatively complex problems and summarize the rules, and then carry out further calculation and obtain the final results. They are widely used in embedded development, large desktop applications and game development, artificial intelligence and other fields. In college teaching, the teaching of computer programming language is popular and important. However the main goal in traditional teaching is to impart professional knowledge, complete the “teaching” part, but it often ignore the “education” link. In teaching process, we should take moral education as our goal, integrate the socialist core values, reform the teaching contents and methods. It will finally realize the organic combination of core values and professional courses. Combing with the requirements of Ideological and political curriculum, the starting point and integration methods of Ideological and political curriculum are discussed in this essay.},

There is a significant need to develop technology based methods for effective intervention and cure. We propose an interactive game design which uses modern computer vision and computer graphics techniques. This game tracks facial features and uses tracked features to: 1) recognize the facial expressions of the player, and 2) animate an avatar, which mimics the player's facial expressions.

abstract={Accurate recognition of group behaviors is essential to the design of engaging networked multiplayer games. However, contemporary data-driven machine learning solutions are difficult to apply during the game development process, given that no authentic gameplay data is yet available for use as training data. In this paper, we investigate the use of synthetic training data, i.e., gameplay data that is generated by AI-controlled agent teams programmed to perform each of the behaviors to be recognized in groups of human players. The particular task we focus on is to recognize group movement formations in player-controlled avatars in a realistic virtual world. We choose five typical military team movement patterns for the formation recognition task and train machine learning models using procedurally generated unit trajectories as training data. The experiments were conducted using ResNet and EfficientNet, which are two popular convolutional neural network architectures for image classifications. The synthetic data is augmented by creating variations in image rotation, unit spacing, team size, and positional perturbations to bridge the gap between synthetic and human gameplay data. We demonstrate that high-accuracy behavior recognition can be achieved using deep neural networks by applying the aforementioned data augmentation methods to simulated gameplay data.},

abstract={Virtualization technologies have become common-place both in software development as well as engineering in a more general sense. Using virtualization offers other benefits than simulation and testing as a virtual environment can often be more liberally configured than the corresponding physical environment. This, in turn, introduces new possibilities for education and training, including both for humans and artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we are developing a simulation platform AILiveSim. The platform is built on top of the Unreal Engine (www.unrealengine.com) game development system, and it is dedicated to training and testing autonomous systems, their sensors and their algorithms in a simulated environment. In this paper, we describe the elements that we have built on top of the engine to realize a Virtual Environment (VE) useful for the design, implementation, application and analysis of autonomous systems. We present the architecture that we have put in place to transform our simulation platform from automotive specific to be domain agnostic and support two new domains of applications: autonomous ships and autonomous mining machines. We describe the important specificity of each domain in regard to simulation.In addition, we also report the challenges encountered when simulating those applications, and the decisions taken to overcome these challenges.},

abstract={Modern society is witnessing an increase in average life expectancy. Nowadays, stroke represents one of the major causes of disabilities worldwide usually among older adults. The stroke is a type of cerebrovascular accident that may cause motricity and cognitive impairments. The recovery process usually lacks a patient-centric strategy, relying on a set of long, painful and difficult physiotherapy sessions. At the same time, the lack of resources from health services and the lack of engagement by patients may lead to an incomplete recovery training program. This research presents the game design process and evaluation of a digital game in two immersive environment displays (Monitor and Head Mounted Display, both with a Leap Motion Controller). “A Priest in the Air“ intends to complement the traditional stroke recovery program with a digital game for the mid/final stage of the upper-limb motor function rehabilitation.},

Our research interrogates these in relation to the people of Kashgar via digital applications. The approach taken is led by a Research through Design (RtD) approach which focuses on immediate user experiences through game design methods.

abstract={This paper considers a class of mean field linear-quadratic-Gaussian (MFLQG) games. The system consists of a large number of negligible agents coupled through their cost functionals. Different to previous mean field game modeling, the stochastic differential equations of agents in our setup are subject to deterministic drift uncertainty satisfying an integral quadratic constraint. We deal with the model uncertainty by a robust optimization approach and formulate a minimax control problem in the infinite population limit. The state aggregation technique is applied where the mean field changes with the drift uncertainty which acts as an adversarial player. Based on the variational and Lagrange multiplier methods, a set of decentralized strategies is derived. The associated Hamiltonian system is represented by a system of coupled mean-field forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and some decoupling methods by Riccati equations are also presented.},

Results have been evaluated in a focus group (N=6) and additional interviews (N=2). In conclusion, six categories were identified, that influence therapy compliance and self-efficacy in both digital and real world environment. Considering these when designing a digital game for CP patients may enhance the success of therapy and quality of a patient's life.},

This method lies in: according to the index weight of TOPSIS method, through the optimal and with the index for standard minimum sum object distance, establishing a nonlinear programming problem about weight, using PSO to determine the weight of the index; on this basis, in order to overcome the shortage of the traditional TOPSIS method, based on set pair analysis connection degree, establishes comprehensive evaluation model of ameliorated TOPSIS method based on connection degrees.

abstract={The relationship between physical activity and educational and health outcomes is well known. As the significance of digital devices continues to increase, along with societal reliance on them, the provision of programs that draw technology and physical activity together is increasingly important. The recent Pokemon phenomenon is an example of a digitally-driven physical activity that appealed to both adults and children alike. This paper reports on the proof of concept phase of a development that brings to digital life a physical activity program designed specifically for preschoolers. The aim of the JumpStart project was to find a way to engage more parents with their children in a physical activity. The brief from the customer was to ensure that the app was appealing to both parent and child with the view to creating a double motivation (push from the child and the parent). It was found through the design process that it was important for the application to appeal to both the child and their significant adult who would be an active participant in explaining and teaching the various skills. The proof of concept phase was introduced to a small group of child users. Informal feedback was collected to inform the completion of the proof of concept. Through the feedback, refinement of the design characteristics was uncovered which allowed a more comprehensive specification to be developed. Based on this proof of concept, the full application is now in development, continuing to explore the connection between co-location and collaboration in digital game design for preschoolers in a more comprehensive research study.},

As a prerequisite, however, volatile RES need to be exploited more efficiently. To raise awareness of end customers for this challenge, a gamification based energy management approach is proposed in this paper. The concept aims at motivating consumers to harmonize their electrical consumption with a volatile generation of RES by applying game design elements to the energy related context. To test the approach, a corresponding field test is conducted. The evaluation of the data collected during the field test shows that the consumers' electricity demand can be influenced by intrinsic incentives in order to shift their electrical consumption into times with high RES availability.},

abstract={Video games have become the most dominant and successful entertainment industry worldwide; however, many video game development (VGD) projects and studios struggle to succeed. At present, there are no commonly accepted VGD best practices or frameworks that can bring together the complex and competing needs of software engineering and creative production. Although studios are reportedly using agile frameworks, the actual extent of application and effectiveness of agile practices in the VGD context is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically determine how and why agile frameworks are applied in VGD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight New Zealand VGD studios. It was found that the agile frameworks, Scrum and Kanban, must often be adapted from their conventional use to meet the needs of different pipelines and delivery milestones within the phases of VGD. However, it seems that not all the needs of VGD can be met by current agile frameworks. Furthermore, inexperience with agile practices often leads to misunderstanding and misimplementing them in ways that seem to contribute to commonly experienced collaboration challenges.},

Considering the selfish nature of the femtocell, how to provide enough incentives to the femtocell base station (FBS) for sharing its resources with the FURUs is challenging. Different from the previous works in this area, we adopt the Stackelberg-game modeling to represent the competition behaviors of the FBS and the users. Specifically, the proposed framework has the FBS to allocate resources to the FURUs through pricing while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of the FRUs, which is done via the optimal solutions of the maximization of the utility functions of the buyers and the revenue of the seller. Simulation results show that upon the QoS of the FRUs are protected, the FBS dynamically determines the list of the accessible FURUs according to the assigned gain to the FURUs and the change of the FRUs' QoS demands.},

abstract={Studies of digital games bridge the gap from game design and technology to the impact of play, thus, being highly interdisciplinary by nature. The scientific discourse is difficult. Pattern is a key term used with largely varying semantics in mind and, even worse, sometimes without any precise meaning. Patterns are general and somehow abstract phenomena that do not show directly, but occur implicitly by means of their instances. Within knowledge processing in studies of game play and its impact, it is decisive to observe instances and to deduce patterns. By its very nature, this is learning from incomplete information. To avoid speculative guesses, studies of learning necessarily need to be based on precise concepts of what to learn and how to learn. The present paper investigates lucid concepts of patterns and their instances, addresses the crucial problem of learning patterns, and illustrates the deployment of a sound theory in practical studies.},

In response to the growing, urgent need for computing technology to be more responsibly and ethically developed, we believe that in addition to the current industry, the necessary change has to also be addressed at the level of computing education to more deliberately and consciously promote computing ethics. Our approach is to have students grapple with, examine and take ownership of the ethical and societal impact of the technologies they learn and build in the courses where they learn those technologies, just as they feel ownership of the technology. We also want the students to examine their perceptions of computing and ethics deeply and through multiple perspectives. We employ practices like role playing, the use of ethical frameworks, case studies, decision making game development, ethics scenario development, workshop on ethics and service learning. Our eventual goal is to have more ethics driven discussion and exercises across different parts of the computing curriculum.},

Besides generating the log on the incidents happening and letting the user observe the simulation, our system also allows the user to get involved in the simulated world as a driver of a vehicle to interact with other cars and people walking around. The issues in analyzing the requirements of agents and implementing agents in an existing platform introduce a new challenge in software design.

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid progress of game development technology as well as human-computer interaction technology, game-based learning (GBL) has not only drew the attention of increasing number of researchers but this method has also been implemented into classrooms by teachers around the world. And the improvement for knowledge acquisition is being reported as the most frequently occurring outcome of GBL across a wide range of subjects like mathematics, physics, health etc. However, there are very limited cases where GBL being employed into music class especially for Chinese traditional musical instruments which are facing the danger of being lost since children today are far less likely to have a chance to play or listen to those beautiful instruments because schools usually focus more on the education of mainstream instruments like pianos and violins. Therefore, the present paper designs and develops an interactive virtual dulcimer auxiliary teaching system based on musical instrument digital interface, which in the future can be utilized as a tool in class to assist teaching or can be promoted as a self-teaching instrument.},

abstract={Path planning is one of the most important process on applications such as navigating autonomous vehicles, computer graphics, game development, robotics, and protein folding. It ensures that a path is planned between an initial and final position on the collision-free region of a search space if one exists. One of the most wide algorithms used for this purpose is the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), in which each node of a tree data structure is generated from a search space by a random sampling process, which originally follows a uniform spatial distribution. However, some authors claim that the addition of a non-uniform/informed approach into the sampling process of the RRT could accelerate the planning time of the algorithm. Actually, many works on literature propose different strategies to include non-uniform/informed behavior on RRT-based algorithms. However, the large number of studies on path planning subject impose difficulties on the identification of new solutions on a review process. The aim of this paper is to structure a review process to deal with the massive volume of works on this subject, by presenting the planning, development, and results of a systematic literature review (SLR), to investigate non-uniform/informed sampling solutions applied to RRT-based algorithms on path planning literature. A review protocol with two scientific questions was developed to guide the investigation. As a result, 1136 studies were selected in the path planning literature, of which 53 were identified as claiming to contain a solution with non-uniform/informed sampling on RRT-based algorithms. As a specific work is considered a scientific contribution only when it has not yet been explored in scientific circles, the results of the SLR can be used as a tool to search for what has not yet been proposed, helping to identify opportunities to contribute with new sampling processes of RRT-based algorithms. To the best knowledge of the authors, this paper presents the first development of an SLR of a topic related to the RRT algorithm.},

abstract={This paper applies the A* algorithm commonly used in game development to mobile robot path planning. Although the A* algorithm is characterized by optimality, simplicity, and flexibility and it has been widely used in path planning, it also has some disadvantages such as redundant points, large memory overhead, and long computing time. In order to improve efficiency and overcome these disadvantages, this paper first combines the Jump Point Search (JPS) and the A* algorithm, and proposes the JA* algorithm, which reduces the redundant points in the search process and improves the efficiency of path planning. Inspired by the bidirectional search algorithm, the BJA* algorithm is proposed based on the JA* algorithm and the improved bidirectional search algorithm, which further improves the speed of the path planning. The simulation results show that the BJA* algorithm is an efficient path planning algorithm for mobile robots, especially in large scenes and scenes requiring high real-time performance.},

abstract={This paper describes a search-based generative method which creates game levels by evolving the intended sequence of player actions rather than their spatial layout. The proposed approach evolves graphs where nodes representing player actions are linked to form one or more ways in which a mission can be completed. Initially simple graphs containing the mission's starting and ending nodes are evolved via mutation operators which expand and prune the graph topology. Evolution is guided by several objective functions which capture game design patterns such as exploration or balance; experiments in this paper explore how these objective functions and their combinations affect the quality and diversity of the evolved mission graphs.},

abstract={In teaching theoretical topics, modern STEM education uses interactive hands-on approaches, which support students in understanding the topic instead of teaching them simply how to memorize theoretical concepts. Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.},

abstract={This article describes an attempt to categorize character configurations of players of Tom Clancy's the Division 2, conducted to highlight behavioral differences in approach to gameplay based on one's character build. Nine distinct character builds were extracted for maximum coherence and minimum variance and each build showed significant differences in separate measures of behavior such as playtime, character health and armor among other attributes. The proposed method was also able to recover builds recognized by social forums as well as discovering new ones. Appropriation of Character builds as categorical text-based data (BaT: Build as Text), provides a unique opportunity for game researchers to use a diverse set of input data which will in turn contribute to the improvement of the process of game design informed by player choices. Longitudinal observations in interconnection of obtained clusters may provide further insight into formation and evolution of gameplay types.},

abstract={The use of simulation in construction project management is not widely adopted. Effective and intuitive tools and techniques to communicate simulation models with industry practitioners are needed. Visualization of simulation behaviors using three dimensional virtual worlds of the simulated construction operations is an effective medium of communication. However, developing visual behaviors to reflect hidden simulation behaviors is time consuming. The relatively small time window available for developing and using simulation models on real construction operations requires a time and cost effective approach for developing simulation driven visualization. This paper describes an approach that utilizes an open source gaming engine to develop parallel and loosely coupled simulation-driven visualizations of industrial construction operations in a distributed simulation environment. The paper focuses mainly on the development pipeline in a step-by-step approach to document and facilitate application of the same approach in similar simulations.},

abstract={This Research to Practice Work-In-Progress Paper will investigate the application of common online or blended teaching and learning strategies with the pedagogy of the Creative Industries sector at University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), particularly focus on the Bachelor of Design - Serious Game Design. This highly interdisciplinary degree has unique challenges of balancing artistic vision, storytelling ability, technical knowledge, and collaboration skills when developing an effective learning environment compared to other subjects within the STEAM fields. The investigation will first outline the common mistakes when transforming face-to-face course design to the online and blended learning environment and introduce five core strategies that better facilitate the design of online or blended subjects in tertiary education. We will then compare and contrast these strategies with the summative learning feedback, which was collected by eVALU8 in the university's centrally supported learning management systems (LMS) at the end of semester 2, 2019 from the subjects conducted by face-to-face mode and the formative feedback, which were distributed by Microsoft Forms at the end of each class in semester 1, 2020 from the same subjects conducted by online and blended learning mode. Since the feedback does not include participant's age data, this paper will only focus on discussing the alignment of the critical components of the online or blended learning environment; the construction of consistent and effective learning experience with cognitive, social, and teaching presence with the existing learning model - Spike; and the opportunity of conducting formative evaluation at the end of each class or learning section in the online and blended environment to prevent learning intervention. These approaches provide insight into how online and blended learning can greatly facilitate the learning experience and teaching practice in STEAM education.},

abstract={Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) plays an important and growing role, both in industrial applications and in game development. Over recent years, robots can be controlled by gestures via special devices, but these methods are not intuitive and require usually a learning phase. This paper proposes an intuitive method for controlling a robot end-effector using human gestures. Vision based techniques were used to track the position of the user's hand, which is directly translated in control signals. The use of a 3D camera sensor allows to easily control the robot tool position in all dimensions. Our approach includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), to ease the control through interactive, visual feedback. This interface, including 3D markers, text messages and the visualization of the user's point cloud and the robot model, enables a control mechanism which does not require a teaching phase. Our approach was tested and evaluated using realistic experiments to prove that our approach works reliably and is extremely intuitive.},

We introduce an analog of the discrete cosine transform for the face-centered lattice relying on multivariate Chebyshev polynomials. A fast algorithm for this transform is deduced based on algebraic signal processing theory and the rich geometry of the special unitary Lie group of degree four.},

abstract={Global software development is becoming increasingly popular. Working in geographically distributed teams affords advantages to both employer and employee alike. Despite this, distributed working remains a point of contention for many organisations, with some claiming it unsuitable for complex collaborative work. Many argue that the complex act of team sense making (the process by which a team develops an understanding of a situation or problem) can only effectively be performed in colocated environments. To investigate this assumption, we examine the communications of a geographically distributed game development team. This global team communicates entirely via forums, yet still manages complex sense making tasks asynchronously. We use thematic analysis to investigate how themes develop during online conversations, and use speech act sequences to explore how understanding is developed during these asynchronous conversations. Our findings demonstrate how collective sense making occurs within a real-world, geographically distributed team.},

A multilevel approach allows examination of how self-efficacy within a group of students at a high school impacts the individual intention to major. The sample is more than 300 students from 40 different high schools across a Midwestern state who enrolled in a year-long inquiry-based educational program on IT-related topics including game design, cyber defense, and robotics. The results showed a higher self-efficacy in IT at the high school level had a strong positive impact on individual student choice to major in IT. This holds true even when the student's individual self-efficacy in IT had no significant impact. Therefore, the axiom that the rising tide raises all boats holds true.},

abstract={Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and CISOs determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members' This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better, or even different decisions than anyone else. Instead we discover that experts of all kinds often obsess over technology, becoming fixated on singular issues, regularly failing to fully comprehend what it is they are defending or how the defenses available to them really work.},

abstract={Deep learning, a derived from machine learning, has grown into widespread usage with applications as diverse as cancer detection, elephant spotting, and game development. The number of published studies shows an increasing interest by researchers because of its demonstrated ability to achieve high performance in the solution of complex problems, the wide availability of data and computing resources, and the groundbreaking development of effective algorithms. This paper reviews the current state of deep learning. It includes a revision of basic concepts, such as the operations of feed forward and backpropagation, the use of convolution to extract features, the role of the loss function, and the optimization and learning processes; the survey of main stream techniques, in particular convolutional, recurrent, recursive, deep belief, deep generative, generative adversarial, and variational auto-enconder neural networks; the description of an ample array of applications organized by the type of technique employed; and the discussion of some of its most intriguing open problems.},

year={2012},
volume={21},

pages={1-15},
abstract={This paper presents a novel multimodal virtual rehabilitation environment. Its design and implementation are based on principles related to intrinsic motivation and game design. The system consists of visual, acoustic, and haptic modalities. Elements contributing to intrinsic motivation are carefully joined in the three modalities to increase patients' motivation during the long process of rehabilitation. The message in a bottle (MIB) virtual scenario is designed to allow interplay between motor and cognitive challenges in the exercising patient. The user first needs to perform a motor action to receive a cognitive challenge that is finally solved by a second motor action. Visual feedback provides the most relevant information related to the task. Acoustic feedback consists of environmental sounds, music, and spoken instructions or encouraging statements for the patient. The haptic modality generates tactile information related to the environment and provides various modes of assistance for the patient's arm movements. The MIB scenario was evaluated with 16 stroke patients, who rated it positively using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaire. Additionally, the MIB scenario seems to elicit higher motivation than a simpler pick-and-place training task.},

abstract={Activity recognition has a growing interest in many fields like biomedical engineering, game development or for sports training. Sensors are attached to a human body to track body movement, physiological signals or environmental variables and these informations are interpreted by algorithms. The finding of characteristics of sensor data for the classification problem plays an important role and is commonly done by hand and with a lot of expertise by the researcher. In this paper, a 2-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract features of images, which are fed in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The key idea are spectrograms produced from 1-D signals of inertial sensors. To evaluate the proposed system, two datasets are used.},

The conference aimed at bringing together researchers from academic and industrial worlds, practitioners and students interested in recent advances in innovative and interactive technologies as well as in their application to entertainment, education, culture, and the arts. This edition of INTETAIN was particularly focused on the human-computer interaction for entertainment. Topics considered were: virtual characters, innovative interfaces, games, collaborative environments, interactive technologies, sensors and much more. These topics have been addressed by paper sessions, demos, posters and a workshop. In particular, a special paper session has been focused on sensors for entertainment, whereas the workshop dealt with providing Conference attendees with a glimpse of the video game development process. For the first time, INTETAIN was technically sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. Submissions received (27 full papers, 19 short papers and 2 posters) were reviewed by 3 Reviewers. This selective process resulted in a high-quality set of accepted papers. Authors of best papers have been invited to submit extend versions of their manuscripts to Special Issues to appear on Sensors and Entertainment Computing. The venue of the 7th edition of INTETAIN was the main campus of Politecnico di Torino, very close to the center of the city.},

abstract={Although AI has excelled at many narrowly defined problems, it is still very far from achieving human-like performance in terms of solving problems that it was not specifically programmed for: hence the challenge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) was developed to foster more general AI research. A promising way to address this is to pose the challenge of learning to play video games without knowing any details of the games in advance. In order to study this in a systematic way the General Video Game AI (http://gvgai.net) competition series was created. This provides an excellent challenge for computational intelligence and AI methods and initial results indicate often good though somewhat patchy performance from simulation-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms. Observing where these methods succeed and fail leads to the conclusion that there is still much scope for further developing algorithms that mix simulation with long-term learning. While running the competitions we have built up a large set of GVGAI players. This large pool of adaptive players leads on to very appealing potential applications in automated and semi-automated game design where the player-set can be used to evaluate novel games and new parameter settings of existing games. Initial explorations of this idea will be discussed.},
